Introduction

Querying Einstein

During his later years, high-energy physicists queried Einstein about the huge numbers of short-lived heavy particles found using high-energy accelerators. They were seeking basic matter and wanted to know Einstein’s thoughts. Einstein was a careful thinker not given to theatrics and was very serious when he replied, I would just like to know what an electron is. Why did he say this? His answer implied that the pedestrian electron, was more important to science than billions of dollars spent on accelerators. Little attention was paid to his remark.

But Einstein saw the electron as the leading player in the universe, as could any careful scientist because most activity of the Universe is electromagnetic energy transfers between electrons. At the time, neither Einstein nor others understood the wave-mechanism of the electron. Although the force between ‘electrons’ can be calculated using elementary rules of Physics 101, the rules did not always match Nature. The electron did not appear to be a discrete particle. Something was wrong and Einstein knew it.

Answering Einstein.

This article shows that the electron is indeed the leading player in the universe, deeply involved with the laws of nature. The way to find this is to follow a suggestion by Clifford and Schroedinger that rejects the discrete material electron (and all material particles) and replaces it with a wave-structured electron. 

The mathematics turns out to be easy because scalar* quantum waves in an un-seen quantum space are the only choice. Further, only a space medium and two principles are needed to obtain all the laws of nature – no more. Amazingly, it is found that the wave structure has all the experimental properties of the electron and you learn the origins of all the laws, thus fulfilling Einstein’s intuition.

NOTE: *A scalar quantity has a single value at each point in space. For example, sound waves (pressure), temperature, and quantum waves are scalar quantities at each point.

The value of philosophy. Einstein was greatly concerned about the electron because he felt that the answer to his question might have a world-wide impact on industry, medicine, our lives, and human affairs, as well as science and the universe. His concern was due to his philosophical understanding of the roots of modern industrial society. In his mind the electron appeared to be an important manifestation of Nature revealing the origins of the natural laws that are the basis of the industry and technology of the modern world. 

Thus knowing the electron would open an enormous window on the world of human affairs. This article will reveal that his intuition was right, as well as that of other pioneer scientists of the electron. As often happens in basic science you, the reader, will find that many of the treasured concepts that you learned and believed to be true, are not true. You must like an ancient philosopher, carefully re-evaluate the evidence for the truth of Nature.

The Problem of the Discrete Electron Seen by Einstein

The structure of the electron had always been a puzzle but in hindsight the obstacle was the erroneous belief (still existing) that it is a discrete material particle. Einstein had already deduced this was impossible since Nature’s forces and properties do not match the discrete particle. Einstein realized that matter is inseparable from the space it occupies. Recognizing this, only a simple amendment is needed: Replace the material point electron with a spherical quantum-wave electron. Then, its wave structure is easily found as a solution of the scalar wave equation to get a quantum-wave electron that is based upon only two fundamental principles of Nature.

This is a new electron in current main-stream thinking, but fulfills early proposals by William Clifford and Schroedinger. Surprisingly, all the natural laws are found embedded in the wave structure of the electron. Unfortunately, this took a long time; Electron research was not as attractive as the richly funded military and industrial programs begun after WWII. ‘Truth is no match for emotions.’

C. Historical Proposals for a Wave Structure of Matter (WSM)

William Clifford (1845-1879) a brilliant mathematician whose legacy includes modern Clifford Algebras, lectured before the Cambridge Philosophical Society [1] on The postulates of the Science of Space. He discussed our ability to deduce the geometry of space at astronomical distances and in space too small (i.e. particles) to be observed, stating: I hold:

That small portions of space are in fact analogous to little hills on a surface which is on the average flat, namely that the ordinary laws of geometry are not valid in them.

That this property of being curved or distorted is continually being passed on from one portion of space to another after the manner of a wave.

That this variation of the curvature of space is what really happens in that phenomenon which we call the motion of matter, whether ponderable or ethereal.

That in this physical world nothing else takes place but this variation subject to the law of continuity.

He concluded that the entire physical world (motion of all matter) therefore all of science and the Universe, was a result of this property of space. This implied that all matter and motion was contained in ONE entity – space. In hindsight, this paper shows that his analysis of the geometric properties of space, more than a century ago, before quantum waves were discovered, were correct. Clifford’s deductions about space were revolutionary at the time because space was not yet a concept that many scientists recognized.

When J. J. Thompson discovered the electron in 1904 using cathode-ray tubes that enabled him to calculate the charge to mass ratio, everyone was convinced that electrons were discrete material particles. This discrete particle belief began to be questioned about 1930, because the ‘wave functions’ of the Schroedinger Equation need not be attached to individual electrons unless you assume that electrons are discrete.

The Equation allows one to assume that discrete material electrons exist, or do not exist. The mathematics of quantum mechanics is neutral and takes no position. The wave functions provide exact values of energy transfers but only hint at how transfer happens. But knowing how was what Einstein wanted. We will see below that it is not possible to know unless you abandon the notion of a discrete particle and instead accept that the electron is a quantum wave structure. Waves can transfer energy, particles cannot.

In 1937, Irwin Schroedinger, the father of quantum theory, proposed [2] to eliminate point particles by using a quantum wave structure. He wrote: What we observe as material bodies and forces are nothing but shapes and variations in the structure of space. Particles are just schaumkommen (appearances). That is, quantum wave structures are real and discrete material particles are not. He was adding one element to the work of Clifford – that the structure of the waves of space lead to the appearances we observe of discrete particles.

These appearances underlie the rules we create to describe the macro world of present day science but only indirectly do we see the real quantum world of Nature itself. Again, by including all material bodies and forces, he was concurring with Clifford and the ancient philosophers, that the space medium is the one substance of everything.

This wave structure is seen as a solution to the scalar wave equation based on two fundamental principles of nature. This proposal, while new in current mainstream thinking, aligns with earlier hypotheses by Clifford and Schroedinger.</p><p>Historically, several researchers have proposed a Wave Structure of Matter (WSM), suggesting that all physical phenomena result from the properties of space.

He sought a response of the universe to the acceleration of an electron, by calculating waves traveling inward and outward from the location of the electron center. This is reviewed in Section E below.

In 1950, Einstein [4] thought about the mechanism of the transmission of force from one particle to another and concluded that space must possess a property that extends throughout space to connect particles. His knowledge of Nature told him that discrete particles cannot exist because their borders would be an abrupt discontinuity. Particles and space must be continuous. Further, assuming the Bohr concept were true, he asserted the notion of a discrete particle being everywhere at once is impossible to imagine. He pointed out that the Bohr ideas are never found in Nature. He rejected the point particle and Maxwell’s field Equations that had become the bible of electrical engineering, writing: The combination of the idea of a continuous field with that of material points discontinuous in space appears inconsistent. Hence the material particle has no place as a fundamental concept in a field theory. Thus even apart from the fact that gravitation is not included, Maxwell's electrodynamics cannot be considered a complete theory.

Ancient Greek philosophers, and modern mathematicians asserted that all matter and motion (the entire universe) was derived from ONE substance. As Leibniz wrote; Reality cannot be found except in One single source, because of the interconnection of all things with one another. … I maintain also that substances, whether material or immaterial, cannot be conceived in their bare essence without any activity, activity being of the essence of substance in general. (Gottfried Leibniz, 1670)

Einstein agreed with this view, thus he rejected the discrete particle conception of matter and tried to represent matter as spherical fields in one thing Space-Time. But later he stated: Time and space and gravitation have no separate existence from matter. We will see below that ordinary space fulfills this role as the unique wave medium of the Universe.

Eric Storri a science historian at Bradley University carefully studied [5] the accuracy of the periodic table of the elements, a foundation stone of chemistry. He found the rules of counting electrons in orbits do not always work. He questioned the assumption that electrons exist inside the wave functions, writing, According to quantum mechanics the very notion of individual electrons in stationary states was shown to be invalid. He concluded, like Einstein, that a full understanding of the Atomic Table requires a better knowledge of the electron.

These leading scientists had concluded that the structure of matter must be formed of quantum waves in space. Recently this has been mathematically worked out by Wolff [6,7], and Mead [8] and is summarized in section H below.

D. Understanding Energy Exchange

We cannot measure anything in Nature without an energy exchange that tells us something has happened. Experience tells us that communication or acquisition of knowledge of any kind occurs only with an energy transfer. Storage of information, whether in a computer disk or in our brain, always requires an energy transfer. Energy is required to move a needle, to magnetize a tape, to stimulate a neuron. There are no exceptions. This rule of nature is embedded in biology and our instruments. Thus, finding the energy transfer mechanism between particles is part and parcel of understanding the electron and the natural laws. Thus we must probe energy deeply. We cannot accept any statement about the measurement of a natural event unless we verify the energy exchange that allowed it. This is the test that distinguishes true from false. Skepticism is good for science.

To understand the mechanism of energy exchange, we first need to understand energy. Most people assume that they understand energy exchange because they buy and use it every day; Accordingly no further thought is needed. This is a logical trap because our human scale experiences are not a guide for the real energy exchanges that take place on the quantum level of electron and atoms.

The mechanism of energy transfer had often been sought using Maxwell's Equations (ME) and electromagnetic waves but the method has problems: The electron has spherical symmetry but MEs have no wave solutions in spherical coordinates. Another problem was the infinite fields (singularities) at the center of the discrete point electron. Singularity avoidance was attempted using mathematical "renormalization" wherein infinity was subtracted from infinity to obtain the desired result. In 1937, Paul Dirac commented [9]: This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it turns out to be small - not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it.

Feynman also commented on the renormalization problem: But no matter how clever the word, it is what I call a dippy process! Having to resort to such hocus pocus has prevented us from proving that the theory of quantum electrodynamics is mathematically self consistent. I suspect that renormalization is not mathematically legitimate.

E. Wheeler and Feynman’s Calculation to Find Energy Transfer

In 1945 Wheeler and Feynman (W&amp;F) sought [3] the mechanism of energy transfer by calculating electro-magnetic radiation from an accelerated electron. Their electron generated outward and inward spherical waves and evoked a response of the universe from absorber charges. They discussed this with Einstein who suggested a proposal by Tetrode [10] that light was two-way communication exchange between source and receiver utilizing in- and out-waves. Tetrode wrote, An atom that emits light from a star one hundred light years away, knew then, one hundred years ago, that it would enter my eye today, before I was even born. They considered his proposal realizing it was controversial because in-waves appear to violate the causality principle: Actions should not appear before their causes. W&amp;F wished to use the in-waves but avoid violation. Their mathematical goal was to verify a formula for radiation force found by Dirac using in/out quantum waves.

Their accelerated electron generated both in- and out-waves. The out-waves then stimulated absorber charges elsewhere in the universe whose waves returned to the initial charge, a response of the Universe. Upon arrival, those waves became in-waves of the initial charge. Remarkably (but as they intended) causality was not violated because in-waves from the absorbers were cancelled upon arrival at the initial charge by opposite in-waves from the charge! Force on the electron was assumed to be the product of charge times half the difference of total in- and out-wave amplitudes. Dirac's formula was verified, independent of absorber properties provided that absorption was complete.

W&amp;F described the wave behavior: Absorber charges at a large distance produce spherical waves headed towards the source. At the moment the source is accelerated these waves just touch the source. Thus all the waves from the absorber charges form an array of approximately plane waves marching towards the source. The Huygens envelope of these plane waves is a spherical in-going wave. The sphere collapses on the source, and then pours out again as a divergent outward wave.

This description above of in-and out-waves is almost identical to the quantum waves of the electron that can be obtained rigorously using a scalar wave equation in Section H below. In hindsight, the partial success of W&amp;F’s method was due to changing the vector e-m waves to scalar waves, during their calculation so that in effect they were calculating scalar quantum waves, even though they assumed the final sum of waves had vector properties. This was not proper math, but nevertheless pointed to quantum waves as the real structure of the electron. They were also forced to assume an illogical behavior of the absorber – the absorber out-waves began before the initial acceleration - in order to arrive at the electron at the moment of acceleration. This switching from vector e-m waves to scalar quantum waves was needed in order to reach their goal.

F. Philosophical Importance

W&amp;F’s work goes beyond explaining radiation forces because energy transfer and the motion of matter are important fundamental processes of nature. Further their concept, that the absorbers in the whole universe contribute to each electron, implies an inter-connection, i.e., Every charged particle is part of the universe and the universe is part of each charged particle. This implies that each of us, you, and me, are connected together as part of the observable universe. It caused much speculation and others, such as Hoyle &amp; Narlikar [11], and Cramer [12] used W&amp;F's work to examine the universe. This fundamental but revolutionary concept is still not recognized by mainstream physics.

G. The Answer to Einstein’s Question

Einstein wished to resolve the disparity between the experimental properties of the electron and the common discrete electron model. He also wanted to know why it appears that "God plays dice" according to the uncertainty interpretation of quantum mechanics, that he did not believe.

Wolff [6,7], Mead [8], and Haselhurst [13] explored the Scalar Wave Equation and found that its solutions form a quantum-wave structure, possessing all the electron’s experimental properties, eliminating the paradoxes of quantum mechanics and cosmology. This wave structure completely replaces the material particle. This is what Einstein wanted to know. Finding that the discrete particle electron does not exist, removes the Bohr interpretation of the wave functions and assures us that God does not play dice as well as removing the infamous wave-particle paradoxes. The mathematical approach below describes the electron, its origin and role in the universe.

Solutions of the Scalar Wave Equation

Waves without Mathematics. You need not be a mathematician to understand the wave structure of the Universe, so I have written the description below in ordinary prose. At the same time, I have also written the related equations. You can read either or both.

Principle I – The scalar wave equation in Space. The universe abounds with things that oscillate, such as; the ocean surface, a violin string, a drum head, a child on a swing, and the structure of electrons and atomic matter. Mathematicians use a wave equation to calculate position and speed of the moving thing but you can also understand the wave process without math if you know what the equation is stating. It describes the energy changes in a wave: i.e. Energy of motion is changing back and forth with energy of position so that the total energy is constant. It is precisely this energy exchanging property that is the heart and role of a wave equation. There is always a wave medium such as: water, a string, a membrane, or a rope. For atomic matter, the medium is space – a quantum-wave medium. To understand the electron we need to assume Principle I:

Quantum waves exist in space and are solutions of a scalar wave equation

Since the universe is three-dimensional, we must use the well-known scalar 3D wave equation. It is pointless to consider an electromagnetic (vector) wave equation – commonly used for radar wave guides – because it has no solutions in free space. Thus this step was easy – only one choice.

Where F is a scalar amplitude, c is the wave velocity ( origin of light velocity), and t is time. The first term describes the energy of position, and the second term describes energy of motion. The whole equation says they must always be equal. There are only two possible spherical wave solutions; again an easy result. They are oscillators:

X

X

Where Fo is the scalar wave amplitude, frequency w = 2πmc2/h, k = wave number, h = Planck’s constant, m = electron mass = hw/c2. The physical dimension r is the radius from a center of the spherical waves. There are only two combinations of these two waves. They form the structure of the electron or positron. They have opposite phase and spin rotation in the electron as compared to the positron as discussed below. Although the variety of molecules in the universe is enormous, the building bricks are just two.

You can picture the waves as continually expanding (F) or converging (Fin) spheres of oscillating energy as drawn in Figure 1. In our human scale perspective we perceive the wave centers as the location of the ‘particles’. But better yet - a trip to your computer will show you moving animated waves of the electron – the four best web sites are:

Waves of the electron-positron. Equations (2a and 2b) are combinations of the in- and out-waves (1a and 1b) that Einstein wished to know:

 (2a)

 (2b)

Both waves exist together converging and diverging from a center. They are actually one continuous wave where the in-wave part reverses direction at the center to become the out-wave part. The reversal is expressed mathematically [14] by rotation (spin) operators, symbolized here by CW and CCW. This rotation is not that of a wheel but is a unique property of 3D space, well known to group theorists, who call it spherical rotation. These operators, that must not tangle up the coordinates of space, allow 720o motions, termed here ‘clockwise’ or ‘counter-clockwise’. Thus the inward wave spherically rotates twice to convert it to an outward wave as is Figure 1. These rotations fulfill a geometric requirement of wave continuity and yield the formerly mysterious quantum spin of value h/4π. Both the amplitude of the waves and the direction of spin are opposite to each other in the electron and positron. This is the reason that superposing an electron and a positron experimentally produces annihilation. Notice how simple Nature makes the electron/positron by choosing the simplest and only means of oscillating in free space!</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs

particles, and waves in the universe! There is a lot of information here, so let's go over some of the key points:</p><ol><li><p>Wheeler and Feynman's pioneering work on energy transfer: In 1945, physicists John Wheeler and Richard Feynman attempted to understand the mechanism of energy transfer in the universe, focusing particularly on the behavior of electrons. They theorized about the existence of waves moving both inward and outward from the location of an electron.</p></li><li><p>Einstein's views on particles and fields: Einstein felt that the idea of discrete particles was inconsistent with the concept of continuous fields, leading him to question the fundamental concepts underlying Maxwell's equations. He believed that particles and space must be continuous and interconnected.</p></li><li><p>Quantum Waves: Over time, several researchers, including Wolff, Mead, and Haselhurst, have explored the idea of quantum waves in space, moving away from the traditional concept of discrete particles and towards a wave-based view of the universe. This approach allows for the modeling of electrons and atomic matter as wave structures, which may help resolve some of the paradoxes in quantum mechanics and cosmology.</p></li><li><p>Understanding Energy Exchange: The text emphasizes the importance of understanding the mechanism of energy exchange. Energy is required for any kind of transfer or storage of information, and thus it is crucial to understand how energy is transferred between particles.</p></li><li><p>W&amp;F’s work on energy transfer: Wheeler and Feynman's work on energy transfer, which involved the concept of absorbers in the universe contributing to each electron, suggested a deep interconnection within the universe.</p></li><li><p>Solutions of the Scalar Wave Equation: This section elaborates on the solutions of the Scalar Wave Equation and how it relates to quantum waves. It also discusses the formation of the structure of electrons and positrons.</p></li></ol><p>These are some fascinating ideas about the fundamental nature of the universe and its constituents. The shift away from viewing particles as discrete entities and towards considering them as wave structures represents a significant change in our understanding of physical reality. This approach offers new insights into quantum mechanics and other areas of physics, as well as posing interesting philosophical questions about our place in the universe.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Look above in Section E above, where W&amp;F approximately described the behavior of the waves of the electron or positron, even though their wave structure were not known at that time. Their description of the in-waves as a Huygens superposition of out-waves from other particles (absorbers) in the universe, as shown in Figure 2, accords with these calculations. Missing from the W&amp;F description was the 720o spherical rotation of the in-wave that changes it to an out-wave. This origin of electron spin was not known before the work of Wolff [6] and Batty-Pratt [14].

The second Principle II of the WSM is used to calculate the density of the quantum wave medium – the space all around us. The role of the medium was foreseen in 1883 by Ernst Mach [15] who noticed that the inertia of a body depended on the presence of the visible stars. His deduction of the familiar law F=ma, arose from two different methods of measuring rotation. First, without looking at the sky one can measure the centrifugal force on a rotating mass m and use the inertia law F = ma to find circumferential speed and position, as in a gyroscope. The second method is to compare the object’s angular position with the fixed (distant) stars. Both methods give exactly the same result. He asserted: "Every local inertial frame is determined by the composite matter of the fixed stars (the universe)" and jokingly, "When the subway jerks, it is the fixed stars that throw you down."

At first, Mach’s Principle was criticized because it appeared to predict instantaneous action-at-a-distance across empty space. How can information travel from here to the stars and back again in an instant? It cannot. The reason is that space is not empty; it is a universal quantum wave medium created by waves from every particle in the universe. Inertia, gravity, and other forces are seen by us as effects of the wave interaction with the surrounding space medium. There is no need to travel across the universe.

Mach’s principle of inertia was the first recognition of the formation and role of space. That is, the matter of the universe creates the wave medium in all space of the Universe. Thus the inertial force of an accelerated object is an energy exchange to the waves in the space around it. In hindsight there is firm evidence: Rotational inertia spinning on a piano stool, the laser gyro, and the observation that space coincides with the fixed stars. The laser gyro used in commercial aircraft is an important application of Principle II.

How is Principle II obtained mathematically? Wolff [6] extended Mach’s Principle by calculating the density of the wave medium as the sum of the squares of the waves from every particle in the universe, each diminished by the inverse square of the distance. Space density, that determines c, is almost constant everywhere because there are so many (about 1080) particles contributing waves. Nevertheless, space density and c vary slightly near large masses like the Sun.

It is important to realize that inertia is an interaction between an accelerated object and its surrounding space. You should not try to imagine the object is interacting with the distant stars. Instead the density of the surrounding space is already created by the waves from the distant stars. This agrees with laboratory experience using gyroscopes, accelerometers, and the laser gyros that navigate aircraft. Before knowledge of the space medium, inertia was a paradox stated by Newton as: action-at-a-distance.

General Relativity. If you think Principle II over carefully, you will see a strange feedback loop in Nature, as follows: The matter of the universe combines to tell the space medium what it is and in turn the medium tells all matter how to behave. In other words: The matter of the universe determines the particles and the particles determine the matter.

The reader may be inclined to disbelieve this strange result. But there are several confirmations, one is Einstein’s General Relativity (GTR) which contains the same feedback loop: Reduced to basics, GTR calculates the density of space-time at each point in space using the density of matter and energy everywhere in the universe. A non-uniform density is referred to as curvature of space. This curvature is then used to determine the paths of moving matter and of light that follow the curvature. Archibald Wheeler expressed this: All the matter of the universe tells space what it is and conversely space tells matter how it must move. The feed back loop is the same. This is not surprising because we have already found that all physical laws are a result of the WSM and its space medium. If GTR were not part of the WSM this would be unexpected indeed. Nevertheless, this feedback in Nature is puzzling and perhaps the reader can find its cause and further meaning.

Equation of the Cosmos. A simple calculation [16] using Principle II also yields an eye-opening relationship between the effective radius r of the electron center, the radius R of the Hubble universe and the number N of particles in the universe, termed the Equation of the Cosmos:

r2 = R2/√ [3N]

The meaning is remarkable! The smallest things of the universe, r, depend only on the largest things, R and N. This equation also expresses the connectivity of matter – each particle depends upon all others in the universe. The computed value of r corresponds with the classical electron radius, approximately 10-15 m. It is the logical common thread between Mach’s Principle, General Relativity, and the philosopher’s concept of ONE substance, which are brought together as consequences of the Wave Structure of matter.

Why can’t we feel ‘space’? Feeling requires a human sensor of energy exchange. We don't have this sense because our survival as an animal species depends mostly on our ability to fight with other animals seeking food, and to compete for mates that produce children. Sensing the medium would not help our survival so Nature has not equipped us to do it. In our self-focused human perspective few of us are aware of the wave medium in which we exist. As Sir Oliver Lodge quipped: A fish cannot comprehend the existence of water. He is too deeply immersed in it.

I. Origin of the Natural Laws

The wave structure of the electron Eqns. (2a &amp; 2b) contains the experimentally observed natural laws. The mathematics are derived by Wolff [6,16] and summarized as follows:

Doppler. The most surprising consequence of the WSM is found from the Doppler effect between two relatively moving wave centers. Say, one is an observer electron and the other is a source (another electron). Using Doppler math, you will find the relativistic mass increase, the Compton and deBroglie wavelengths, and consequently the Schroedinger Equation. At first it seems astonishing that all these occur together but upon reflection it is logical since each of them depends on relative velocity. They are calculated by writing two waves, like Eqns. 2a or 2b, for the two relatively moving electrons. The Doppler effect is then inserted into both the inward and outward waves. Then you find that in each term of the resulting total Doppler shifted wave that contains mass or frequency, there is a relativistic mass-increase factor

The Doppler wavelength becomes the deBroglie wavelength, and, the phase velocity contains the Compton wavelength – the basis of QM! Before the WSM there was no theoretical explanation of either QM or SRT or their common origin. Now the reason is immediately clear from the wave algebra. Note that the in- and the out-waves have symmetrical roles in the Doppler. This means there is no dependence on the direction of the relative velocity, as is experimentally observed.

 

Annihilation of electron and positron waves occurs when super-imposed. This is immediately obvious because Eqn. 2a = - Eqn.2b.

Spin of h/4π occurs due to 3D spherical rotation of the in-wave at the center to become an out-wave. This rotation is. described by the SU2 group theory of Battey-Pratt [14]. The two opposite rotations produce matter and anti-matter that make up the binary universe in which we live. This is especially interesting because group-math theorists have shown that this type of rotation is a property of 3D space only, not 4D, or 10D or 11D etc. Thus matter and anti-matter can occur only in a 3D world.

Energy Conservation occurs because only identical wave states can resonate with each other, producing equal and opposite frequency (energy) shifts.

Electric force interactions appear to us (as proposed by Schroedinger) at the high-density centers. Thus the wave centers look like point charges, as in Figure 3.

Gravity is a property of the behavior of wave centers [13]. It occurs because the in-wave, on arrival at the center, establishes the position and motion of a particle. Matter nearby modifies the density of the surrounding medium, according to Principle II. Then, the changed medium density causes the in-wave to slow down and move the wave-center towards the nearby matter. We observe this motion as a gravity force. Other forces are also produced by a similar change of medium density.

The CPT (charge, parity and time) transformation properties of an electron have been observed in experimental QM for many years but the reasons have not been known. CPT means that if you switch a particle to its opposite property in the order C &gt;P &gt;T you will arrive back to the initial particle. Switching parity is a mirror reflection. That is, r becomes –r. You can easily show with a little algebra that Eqns. 2a and 2b contain the CPT property.

Inertia - The acceleration of matter changes its Doppler frequency relative to the surrounding wave medium. Restoring frequency equilibrium produces energy exchanges with the medium that appears as a local force F=ma. This has been known experimentally since Galileo and Newton, but the reason has not been known until the WSM incorporated Mach’s Principle.

The New Electrodynamics

Prof. Carver Mead, an engineer at Cal Tech investigated the e-m consequences of the WSM in his 2000 book "Collective Electrodynamics" [8]. This book is very popular in Silicon Valley because it shows correct ways to solve the electromagnetics of transistor circuits. He recognized that the electron is not a point particle but a wave structure. Thus the approximations of Maxwell’s Equation do not work when dimensions approach the quantum region, especially magnetism. Mead made use of the electron wave structure observed at low temperatures [17] to derive a vector potential analogous to Principle II. This replaced the erroneous magnetism of Maxwell Equations – an error foreseen by Einstein. Mead’s work begins an important future for wave-based electromagnetism.

Conclusions

The proposals of Clifford and Schroedinger were correct that an electron is a continuous wave structure in space not a material particle, and our observation of point particles and electromagnetic waves are merely appearances (schaumkommen). The Schroedinger wave functions must be interpreted as the electron itself, as seen at the Dean Dauger (UCLA) animation site above. As a result, the classic paradoxes, ‘renormalization’, wave-particle duality, and Copenhagen uncertainty, no longer exist.

Unity of the Universe. The wave medium - the space around us - is the ONE source of matter and the natural laws. Since the waves of each particle are inter-mingled with the waves of other matter and all contribute to the density of the medium, it follows that every charged particle is part of the universe and the universe is part of each charged particle.

Principle II (extended Mach principle) shows that the stars and galaxies of the universe are essential to the laws of Nature and to the existence of the Earth and ourselves. This important fact is not presently familiar to the science community. For example, the present Standard Model of the universe contain no recognition of Mach’s Principle, nor our inter-connection with the universe.

Why has the science community not sought the WSM? There is a dark side to the development of science. It is tempting to imagine scientists as noble pioneers, questing for the greater good of humanity, and transfixed by the wonderful mysteries of the world. However scientists are no different than you or I. The day-to-day history of nearly every radical discovery tells an entirely different story portraying a community that will eat its own in the name of progress and where each member usually votes his pocketbook.

All the deadly sins of man and womankind are found in the hearts of scientists. Knowing this helps understand why the science community has not sought the Wave Structure of Matter. It will take a long time to dispel treasured scientific illusions even though following the path of the discrete particle leads science down a dead end street. Figure 4.

L. The Future

There will be new valuable applications of the WSM in technologies concerned with the behavior of matter at small molecular dimensions: especially, nanotechnology, the design of new alloys and catalysts, more efficient power transmission, understanding the mechanisms of biology and medicine, building molecular computers and memories.

The description of the wave structure appears to be based on work by Wolff and Batty-Pratt.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mach's Principle and the Quantum Wave Medium</strong>: The passage also discusses Mach's Principle, which suggests that the inertia of an object is influenced by all other matter in the universe. The author interprets this principle as indicating the existence of a "quantum wave medium" created by the waves from all particles in the universe. This medium is seen as the substrate for all wave interactions and fundamental forces.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wave Structure and Physical Laws</strong>: The author suggests that the wave structure of matter explains numerous physical laws and phenomena, including Doppler effects, the annihilation of particles and antiparticles, spin, energy conservation, electromagnetic forces, gravity, CPT transformation properties, and inertia.</p></li><li><p><strong>The New Electrodynamics</strong>: The passage mentions work by Carver Mead, who developed a form of electromagnetism based on the wave structure of the electron, and replaced the magnetism of Maxwell's equations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implications for Science</strong>: Finally, the author argues that the WSM paradigm can resolve many paradoxes in quantum mechanics and special relativity theory, and can bring about significant advancements in science and technology.</p></li></ol><p>As an AI developed by OpenAI, I should clarify that as of my last training data in September 2021, the Wave Structure of Matter is not a mainstream theory in physics. It is an alternative model that has not been widely accepted by the scientific community. Theories such as quantum mechanics and general relativity continue to be the most widely supported theories for describing the behavior of particles and the structure of the universe, respectively.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">I think that it has been established that all particles exhibit wave like behavior from atoms to baseballs.

concept of wave-particle duality. According to quantum theory, particles can be described not just as discrete points, but also as wave-like entities. This property is captured by the particle's wavefunction, a mathematical description of its quantum state.</p><p>Wave-particle duality is often expressed through the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that it's impossible to accurately know both the position and momentum of a quantum particle at the same time. The more precisely one measures one quantity, the less precisely one can know the other.</p><p>Indeed, wave-like behavior has been observed not only in elementary particles, but also in larger, more complex systems. For example, experiments have demonstrated wave-like behavior in molecules like fullerenes (also known as buckyballs).</p><p>However, we generally don't observe wave-like behavior in everyday objects like baseballs, and there are a couple of reasons for this. One is that the effects of quantum mechanics tend to become less noticeable as objects get larger. For a baseball, the wavelength associated with its quantum wave-like behavior would be so incredibly small that it would be completely undetectable by any known experimental method.</p><p>Another reason is that larger objects interact more with their environments, which causes a process known as decoherence. Decoherence is essentially the loss of quantum behavior as a quantum system interacts with its environment and essentially becomes entangled with it. As a result, a baseball's wave-like behavior would decohere almost instantaneously, making it behave like a classical object.</p><p>So, while it's technically true to say that all particles exhibit wave-like behavior due to the principles of quantum mechanics, this behavior is not observable for larger objects under normal conditions.</p><p>As for the originality of the theory, quantum mechanics is a well-established theory that's been developed over the past century. Any new theory that involves quantum behavior would need to either build upon or replace the existing framework of quantum mechanics. And any such theory would be subject to rigorous testing and scrutiny to see if it can reproduce the successful predictions of quantum mechanics and provide new insights or predictions.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Yeah so wouldn't the electron cloud be seen as an inwave and an outwave?

theory or de Broglie-Bohm theory. According to this interpretation, each particle is accompanied by a wave, which guides the particle's motion. The particle itself always has a definite position and velocity, contrary to the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p><p>In this theory, the particle is guided by a "pilot wave" that arises from the superposition of two waves: an "in-wave" coming from all other particles in the universe and converging on the particle in question, and an "out-wave" originating from the particle and spreading out to all other particles.</p><p>This is quite a different concept from the electron cloud model, which is usually understood in terms of the wavefunction from standard quantum mechanics. According to the standard interpretation, the electron cloud around an atom represents the regions where the electron is most likely to be found, according to the probability distribution given by the square of the wavefunction.</p><p>Regarding the temperature of the universe and energy, it's correct that the universe is both radiating and absorbing energy. For example, every object in the universe that has a temperature above absolute zero emits thermal radiation. At the same time, objects can absorb radiation that's incident on them.</p><p>However, this is a classical concept that applies to macroscopic objects, and it's separate from the quantum behavior of particles. It's also worth noting that while individual particles can absorb and emit energy, they don't have a temperature in the same sense that macroscopic objects do. The concept of temperature is a statistical one that applies to systems with a large number of particles.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

topics! Physics, especially quantum mechanics, can be very challenging to understand, especially without a rigorous formal education in the field.</p><p>The important thing to keep in mind is that many of the concepts in quantum mechanics, such as wave-particle duality and electron clouds, are inherently counterintuitive. They don't align with our everyday experience of the world, so they can be difficult to grasp.</p><p>If you're interested in learning more about these subjects, I would recommend starting with some introductory resources, such as popular science books or online lectures that are designed for beginners. This can provide you with a more solid foundation in the basics, which you can then build on by delving into more advanced topics.</p><p>Please feel free to ask any specific questions you have, and I'll do my best to provide clear and understandable answers!</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">I'll give you a basic overview of the idea:

particles and the laws. The predictive power of the WSM is shown by deriving the previously unknown physical origin of electron spin and making experimental predictions which solve the paradoxes of the famous EPR experiment. The WSM has important implications for research, industry, and our human role in the universe.

Part I - Introduction
1. Natural laws.
Our knowledge of science is based on the natural laws that describe the behaviour of particles. The laws are the rules for calculating electricity, gravity, relativity, quantum mechanics, and conservation of energy and momentum. The origins have been unknown. Now the origin of the natural laws is found to be a quantitative result of a Wave Structure of Matter (WSM). The basic method is very simple. The ancient Greek notion of a point particle, still in use today, is replaced with a spherical wave structure, thus confirming the beliefs of Clifford1 and Schroedinger2 that the Wave properties of both Light and Matter are in fact real.

Figure 1. The Electron. The electron is composed of spherical waves which converge to the center and then become outward waves. The two waves form a standing wave whose peaks and nodes are like the layers of an onion. The wave amplitude is a scalar number like a quantum wave, not an electromagnetic vector wave (a mathematical wave of force). The Wave-Center is the apparent location of the electron 'particle'.

Represents Spherical In-Wave (our future) flowing In to form the Wave-Center (our present) + Represents Spherical Out-Wave (our past) flowing Out of the Wave-Center (our present) = Combined In-Waves and Out-Waves form a Spherical Standing Wave about the Wave Center (our present). This explains the particle / wave duality of Matter. Matter is a Spherical Standing Wave - the Wave-Center causes the 'particle' effect of matter. This (very rough!) diagram shows how the Spherical In and Out Waves form a Standing Wave around the Wave-Center 'particle'.

The simplicity is illustrated by Figure 1. which shows the structure of an electron. It is just two waves: an inward wave converging to the Wave-Center, combined with an outward diverging wave, forming a Spherical Standing Wave about the Wave-Center (which we observe as the point 'particle'). The properties of these simple waves are immense when combined with the equally simple waves of the proton. The myriad combinations are like the eight note musical scale which become the grand symphonies of Wagner and Beethoven.

The rules of wave combination are of great importance to science because the rules and quantum spin determine the structure of the Atomic Table, which dictates the varied forms of matter: metals, crystals, semi-conductors, and the molecules of life. The deep understanding of basic physics that is revealed opens a door to broad fields of applied technology such as integrated circuits, photonics, and commercial energy. It reveals a universe of real quantum wave structures in a space medium that we live in but seldom are aware of. The medium is the heart of wave structure because its properties underlie the wave properties.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

The basic idea is that these standing waves are composed of an inward wave (which we can call an 'in-wave') and an outward wave (an 'out-wave'), both centered around what is known as the wave center.</p><p>The wave center, according to this theory, is what we perceive as a point particle. The spherical standing wave, formed by the interference of the in-wave and out-wave, is what actually constitutes the "particle". This perspective aims to explain the wave-particle duality, a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, by stating that what we consider to be a particle is in fact a wave structure.</p><p>In terms of your statement about the electron cloud being an in-wave and an out-wave, the electron cloud in quantum mechanics is often interpreted as a probability cloud showing where the electron is likely to be found. This differs from the concept of in-wave and out-wave in WSM. In WSM, the in-wave and out-wave are components of the standing wave that forms the particle.</p><p>Please keep in mind that while this is a fascinating theory, it is considered alternative and not widely accepted in the field of physics as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. The mainstream view of quantum mechanics is quite different, and the interpretation of quantum mechanical phenomena is still a subject of active debate.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Yeah I know it's hypothetical, or else it is using unusual terminology:

2. Human senses and survival.

We don't easily see the space wave medium because our survival as an animal species depended mostly on our ability to fight with other animals seeking food, and to compete for mates that produce children, not closely related to the quantum space medium. Our sensory mechanisms evolved to directly aid our survival not to be aware of quantum matter. In our self-focused human perspective few of us are even aware of the wave medium in which we exist. For survival, it doesn't matter what space is, or whether we can observe it - it exists unseen. This situation is much like the life of a fish who cannot comprehend the existence of water because he is too deeply immersed in it. Like the fish, traditional scientists have tended to comprehend the universe in terms of their local experiences.

Our misconceptions are revealed by anthropology, which teaches that the quantum wave universe is not as helpful to survival of our personal genes as recognizing apples we can eat and avoiding tigers who want to eat us. We need to recognize those quickly. Thus it was not necessary that nature equip us to observe quantum waves, although as will be seen below we do observe their presence and effects. Lacking direct personal experience of simple quantum waves, people chose to imagine that the electron is a discrete 'particle,' like a bullet. Laboratory evidence does not support this human-oriented idea.

Accordingly, belief must change from discrete particles to quantum wave structure.
Human perspective has another bias. We tend to see space as three rectangular dimensions, one of which is the vertical gravity vector of Earth, plus two other vectors perpendicular to it, shaped like the houses we live in. But in the cosmos, the shape of the enormous universe is spherical whose important dimensions are inward and outward, the direction of waves in space. In fact it requires three coordinates to describe a sphere, and it is this spherical geometry of Matter that is the cause of the three rectangular dimensions (as formalised by Descartes). In the vast expanse of the real universe, gravity occurs so rarely, that its direction is inconsequential in the larger scheme of things, despite its local importance to us. Accordingly, we feel comfortable with rectangular coordinates but tend to ignore the spherical universe. This explains why Einstein used Spherical Geometry in his General Relativity, he writes;

From the latest results of the theory of relativity it is probable that our three dimensional space is also approximately spherical, that is, that the laws of disposition of rigid bodies in it are not given by Euclidean geometry, but approximately by spherical geometry.

The proof of the WSM is that the physical structure of the electron, and the empirical natural laws can be obtained mathematically from three basic principles describing the wave space medium. In other words, all the experimental measurements of historical physics that described natural behaviour are now predicted by three fundamental principles. The laws and the principles agree with each other - each is the proof of the other.

You will see that the wave structure of matter is simple. In contrast, old discrete particle-structured physics required dozens of assumptions plus many more arbitrary constants to explain the operation of the laws. Many properties and laws, like electron spin, were puzzling with no understanding or origin. The puzzles are now swept away. Particle-structured physics can be compared to the theory of epicycles of the planets around the Earth before Galileo found that the planets travelled around the Sun. It satisfies our human prejudices but does not explain the measured facts.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center

This excerpt delves into some philosophical and psychological dimensions of understanding physics, making the argument that our evolved sensory and cognitive systems may not be well-suited to intuitively grasp the reality of quantum mechanics and the wave structure of matter.</p><p>The argument presented here is that human perception and understanding are largely shaped by survival needs, leading us to perceive the world in ways that favor immediate survival and reproductive success, not necessarily scientific or philosophical accuracy. Just as a fish might not recognize water because it's so deeply immersed in it, humans may not easily understand the concept of the wave structure of matter because we're so deeply immersed in it and our senses are not designed to detect it directly.</p><p>The argument goes on to suggest that the common perception of particles as point-like entities, rather than wave structures, is a result of this anthropocentric bias. It posits that humans have preferred to understand particles as discrete entities, like small bullets, because this makes intuitive sense based on our everyday experiences. However, this view is at odds with the wave-particle duality demonstrated in quantum mechanics.</p><p>Finally, the excerpt touches on the idea that our perception of space as three rectangular dimensions might be too limited. The author suggests that the universe is better understood as spherical, not rectangular, and that our bias toward rectangular coordinates is a product of our Earth-bound perspective.</p><p>It's a thought-provoking perspective, combining elements of physics, evolutionary biology, and philosophy. However, it's crucial to remember that the WSM theory, while interesting, is not widely accepted in the scientific community as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. Mainstream quantum mechanics takes a different approach to these phenomena.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">founded on a priori principles rather than a posteriori /empirical observations (which as Hume pointed out, were uncertain, merely habits of thinking that depended upon the assumption that the future would continue to be like the past). Kant writes;

'Natural science (physics) contains in itself synthetical judgmentsa priori, as principles.'
Kant also realised that Space was a priori;
'Space then is a necessary representation a priori, which serves for the foundation of all external intuitions. We never can imagine or make a representation to ourselves of the non-existence of space, though we may easily enough think that no objects are found in it. It must, therefore, be considered as the condition of the possibility of appearances, and by no means as a determination dependent on them, and is a representation a priori, which necessarily supplies the basis for external appearances.'

Accordingly the search for origins must probe deeper into the nature of Space than heretofore and we must be prepared to find new perspectives. The unexplained puzzles of nature, of particles and of cosmology are attractive sources of input data in the search for the origins of empirical laws. Finally, the proof of the origins of laws so deduced is a match between the observed empirical rules and the predictions of the new origins.

Circular reasoning. When seeking origins, it is important not to inadvertently use existing rules (laws) to deduce them.  Such circular reasoning can occur if, for example, a mechanical model from macro-physics is assumed to be the structure of an electron. Such common errors are the use of toy tops, sheets and rings of charge, masses in orbit around each other, Although the quantum laws of quantum particles can be extrapolated to large macro-objects,  the inverse is not possible.  Logically, finding the origins of existing laws (rules) requires forming new concepts that nevertheless satisfy observed data.
As Einstein writes;

Physics constitutes a logical system of thought which is in a state of evolution, whose basis cannot be distilled, as it were, from experience by an inductive method, but can only be arrived at by free invention. ... We must always be ready to change these notions - that is to say, the axiomatic basis of physics (Principles) - in order to do justice to perceived facts in the most perfect way logically. ... It is the grand object of all theory to make these irreducible elements (Principles) as simple and as few in number as possible, without having to renounce the adequate representation of any empirical content whatever. ... If, then, it is true that the axiomatic basis of theoretical physics cannot be extracted from experience but must be freely invented, can we ever hope to find the right way? I answer without hesitation that there is, in my opinion, a right way, and that we are capable of finding it. I hold it true that pure thought can grasp reality, as the ancients dreamed. (Einstein, Ideas and Opinions, 1954)

The new perspective. The discovery of these origins creates a radical new perspective of the physical world: Quantum Mechanics and Einstein's Relativity are united, a single origin of forces is found,  puzzles and paradoxes are explained and, most important, relationships between microphysics (electrons and particles) and the universe (cosmology) are seen to be a result of an all-pervading space (the vacuum, ether, wave medium) filled with oscillating quantum waves of the matter of the universe.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center

emphasizing the necessity of rethinking our concepts about physical reality in order to accommodate the theory's perspectives. The excerpt begins by referencing Immanuel Kant's philosophy of science, and then segues into a cautionary note against circular reasoning when seeking the origins of the laws of nature.</p><p>Immanuel Kant is a well-known philosopher who proposed the idea that some of our knowledge is a priori, meaning it is independent of specific experiences. According to Kant, such a priori knowledge includes the concepts of space and time, which form the necessary foundation for all our perceptions of the external world.</p><p>The WSM theory, as presented in this excerpt, aligns with this Kantian perspective by proposing that we must understand the nature of space more deeply and be prepared to revise our existing concepts about the physical world.</p><p>The excerpt also touches upon the dangers of circular reasoning in the search for the origins of the laws of nature. It warns against using analogies from macroscopic physics, which could lead to incorrect or incomplete understanding of quantum phenomena. The idea here is that to truly understand quantum phenomena, we must be open to concepts that are fundamentally different from those in classical physics, even though they must still be consistent with observed data.</p><p>The excerpt ends by suggesting that this revised perspective leads to a new, unified understanding of Quantum Mechanics and Einstein's Relativity. It also implies that this new perspective reveals a deep connection between microphysics (the physics of particles) and cosmology (the physics of the universe as a whole), mediated by the concept of an all-pervading space filled with quantum waves.</p><p>As with previous excerpts, remember that these are interesting ideas that are part of a minority viewpoint within the scientific community. The mainstream scientific perspective, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, maintains that Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity are separate theories that each work well within their own domains, but that a complete unification of these theories has not yet been achieved.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Figure 2. Inter-dependence. Laws particles, and the cosmos are inter-connected by the quantum waves of particle structures in the 'ether' medium of space. These interconnections are described by three Principles that define the properties of the space medium.

6. Particle Properties Require Perception-communication Between Particles. 

  If there were no means for each particle to sense the presence of other matter in its universe, the required dimensional relationships above could not be established. How can a particle possess a property that is dependent on other particles, if there is no way for the particles to impart their presence to each other?  Without communication, each particle would be alone in its own separate universe. Therefore continual two-way perceptive communication between each particle and other matter in its universe is needed to establish the laws of Nature.  Spherical quantum waves forming the particles are the means of communication. The laws are then established in terms of the dimensions (units) established by waves of the entire ensemble of matter.

7. The Measurement of Time requires a cosmological clock.  

Using reasoning similar to the above but for the dimension of time, we can conclude that time measurement requires the existence of cyclic events among the particles of the universe; a kind of clock. Those properties of particles that involve the measurement of time, notably velocity, mass and frequency, cannot have a meaning if particles have no scale of time. That is, the particles must have a way to compare their own cyclic events with other particles.  Therefore, there must exist a standard cosmological clock. One proposal by de Broglie is an oscillator (clock) contained in every electron. By viewing his proposal in a wave medium, we see that electron oscillators can communicate with other electrons and particles. Because of the uniformity of space (the oscillator medium) the clock frequencies would be alike throughout the universe. We should note that a nearly uniform space medium is required in nature, otherwise each clock would tick independently of others; different clocks in different places would produce chaos of the laws. Natural laws involving time would be meaningless.
Thus we realise that Wave Motions are the underlying Cause of Time (and Matter), something both Aristotle and Spinoza suspected;

..about Matter's coming into being and all its alterations we think that we have knowledge when we know the source of its movement.
... there is some other cause of the change. And to seek for this is to seek for the second kind of principle, as we would say, that from which comes the beginning of the change. ... Unless the further factor is active, there will still be no movement.
Motion must always have been in existence, and the same can be said for Time itself, since it is not even possible for there to be an earlier and a later if time does not exist. Movement, then, is also continuous in the way in which time is - indeed time is either identical to movement or is some affection of it. ... there being two causes of which we have defined in the Physics, they seem to have a glimpse of them, that of matter and that from which the motion comes, indistinctly though, and in no way clearly. (Aristotle, 350BC Metaphysics)

Moreover, no one doubts but that we imagine time from the very fact that we imagine other bodies to be moved slower or faster or equally fast. (Spinoza, Ethics)</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

theoretical propositions of the Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) theory, including the concepts of interdependence, the necessity of communication between particles, and the definition of time.</p><ol><li><p>Inter-dependence: According to the WSM theory, laws, particles, and the cosmos are interconnected through quantum waves in the 'ether' medium of space, described by three fundamental principles defining the properties of the space medium.</p></li><li><p>Perception-communication Between Particles: WSM theory suggests that for particles to establish properties dependent on other particles, a continuous two-way communication mechanism is required. This communication, according to the theory, is achieved through the spherical quantum waves forming the particles. This results in the establishment of the laws of Nature based on the dimensions established by the ensemble of matter's waves.</p></li><li><p>The Measurement of Time requires a cosmological clock: Similarly, for the measurement of time, the WSM theory proposes the necessity of cyclic events among particles of the universe. This implies a standard cosmological clock for time measurement, which is consistent throughout the universe due to the uniformity of the space medium. The idea here is that the cyclic motion of waves is the underlying cause of time (and matter).</p></li></ol><p>The theory draws upon the thoughts of notable philosophers like Aristotle and Spinoza to support its propositions. Aristotle's view on motion being an inherent property and the cause of time aligns with the WSM theory's proposition of wave motions as the root cause of time. Similarly, Spinoza's thoughts on the perception of time due to the observation of other bodies moving at different speeds resonate with the idea of a cosmological clock.</p><p>Please note that while these ideas are intriguing, they are still a part of a minority viewpoint within the scientific community and are not part of mainstream scientific consensus. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there's no complete unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity, and the concept of 'ether' is not generally accepted in modern physics.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">suggests that the whole universe of particles is involved, i.e. Every charged particle is a structural part of the universe and the whole universe contributes to each charged particle. Their work pioneered the concept that every particle sends quantum waves outward, and receives an inward response from the universe. In hindsight, if they had used scalar quantum waves entirely, this paper would have appeared 55 years ago. A hair's breadth separates the false and true.

Research of wave structure. After 1945, particle physicists chose to work on post WWII weapons. Research on wave structure stopped until 1985 when Milo Wolff 8,9, using a scalar wave equation with spherical quantum wave solutions, found the Wave Structure of Matter described here. It successfully predicted the natural laws and the properties of the electron, except its spin. Below, this article describes the WSM, derives a physical origin of spin that accords with quantum theory and the Dirac Equation, and adds new results.

Part IV - The Wave Structure of Matter
The wave-structured electron, Figure 1, is termed a space resonance (SR) or Spherical Standing Wave (SSW). Space, that supposed void of which we formerly knew little, is the medium of the waves and the leading player in this new physics of the universe. The properties of electrons, other matter, and the laws they obey are derived from properties of the medium - space. Thus, space described by three principles, underlies our knowledge of the sciences.

12. Principle I. The Wave Equation (Space is a Wave-Medium and Propagates Wave-Motions)
This Principle describes how quantum waves are formed and travel in the space medium. The wave amplitudes are scalar numbers. If the medium is uniform, typical nearly everywhere, only spherical waves occur. If observed in relative motion, Doppler modulation and elliptical waves appear. If the medium is locally dense, as in the central region of a proton, waves circulate like sound waves in a drum or a crystalline sphere.

Principle I is: Quantum matter waves exist in space and are solutions of a scalar wave equation:

Scalar Wave Equation (1)

Where F is a scalar amplitude, c is the velocity of light, and t is the time. Its solutions in Figure 1, are a pair of spherical in/out waves that form the simple structure of the electron or positron. Being superimposed, they form a resonance in the space medium.

Outward wave = Fout = (1/r) F0 exp(iwt - kr)

Inward wave = Fin = (1/r) F0 exp(iwt + kr) (2)

These two waves can be combined in only two ways to form continuous spherical wave structures (See Figure 1) that form charged 'particles':

electron = Fin- Fout + CW spin

positron = Fout - Fin + CCW spin(3)

There are only two combinations of the two in/out waves which have opposite phase and spin rotation to form electrons and positrons. Thus matter is constituted of binary elements - like computer hardware. Although the variety of molecules and materials populating the universe is enormous, the building bricks are just two, a spherical In-Wave and a Spherical Out-Wave.</div></div><div class="flex

details about the Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) theory. It highlights the foundational work in the mid-20th century that led to this concept, although mainstream research veered away from it after World War II. Milo Wolff's work in 1985 restarted the study of wave structure and his findings form the basis of the theory.</p><p>Key points discussed in this text:</p><ol><li><p>Principle I - The Wave Equation: WSM theory proposes that space is a wave-medium that propagates wave motions. The properties of matter and the laws they follow are derived from properties of this space medium. This is described by a wave equation in which the amplitudes of the waves are scalar quantities.</p></li><li><p>Wave Structures: The wave-structured electron is described as a space resonance (SR) or Spherical Standing Wave (SSW). According to the theory, there are two types of waves (outward and inward) forming the structure of an electron or a positron.</p></li><li><p>Electron and Positron: WSM theory proposes that these subatomic particles are formed by different combinations of these inward and outward waves, with differing phases and spin rotations. The electron is formed from the inward wave minus the outward wave with clockwise spin, while the positron is formed from the outward wave minus the inward wave with counterclockwise spin.</p></li></ol><p>Again, it's important to note that this theory represents a minority viewpoint within the scientific community. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, this concept hasn't been widely adopted or validated in mainstream physics. Physics continues to evolve, and new models and theories continue to be proposed, but this does not necessarily mean they are accepted or correct. They need to be validated through experimental data and peer review.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">choosing the transition. In the source, the frequency (energy) of a wave state shifts downward. In the receiver, there is an equal shift upward, as in Fig. 5. Only wave states (oscillators) with equal frequencies 'tuned' to each other can couple and shift frequency. Accordingly, the frequency (energy) changes must be equal and opposite. This is exactly the content of the Conservation of Energy law, not too different from tuning up an orchestra matched to the 'A' played by the first violin! Instruments which cannot resonate are not allowed.

This mechanism also describes the phenomenon noted by Einstein in the writing of Tetrode5,10, When I see a star 100 light-years away, the star knew that its light would enter my eye, 100 year ago - before I was born! Tetrode was predicting that energy exchange is a two-way symmetrical process between source and receiver - not a one-way photon. This energy transfer mechanism lies at the heart of cosmology. If you use the traditional assumption that matter consists of points of mass and charge substance where energy exchange is a one-way e-m photon travelling between particles, you are doomed to the paradoxes of causality violation, wave-particle duality, Heisenberg uncertainty, redshift, and others. Only the two-way exchange of the WSM matches observation. Even though Einstein had originally proposed the 'photon' he never understood the cause of these discrete energy exchanges of light. In 1954 Einstein wrote to his friend Michael Besso expressing his frustration;

All these fifty years of conscious brooding have brought me no nearer to the answer to the question, 'What are light quanta?' Nowadays every Tom, Dick and Harry thinks he knows it, but he is mistaken.

Einstein also came to realise that Matter could not be described by a continuous field - and it cannot simply because Spherical Standing Wave interactions (which cause the 'field effect') are discrete rather than continuous;

I consider it quite possible that physics cannot be based on the field concept, i.e., on continuous structures. In that case, nothing remains of my entire castle in the air, gravitation theory included, [and of] the rest of modern physics. (Einstein, 1954)

20. The Origin of the IN Waves and the Response of the universe.
At first thought, it is puzzling where the in-waves come from. This puzzle is our own fault - a result of looking at the waves of only one particle, and ignoring the waves of all other particles in space - over simplification! To find reality, we must deal with the real wave-filled universe. When we study this question5,10 we find a rational origin of the inward waves.

Three hundred years ago Christiaan Huygens, a Dutch mathematician, found that if a surface containing many separate wave sources was examined at a distance, the combined wavelets appeared as a single wave front having the shape of the surface as shown in Fig. 6.
This wave front is termed a 'Huygens Combination' of the separate wavelets. This mechanism is the origin the in-waves whereby our In-Waves are formed from a Huygens' Combination of the Out-Waves of all the other Matter in the Universe. This occurs throughout the universe so that every particle depends on all others to create its in-wave. We have to think of each particle as inextricably joined with other matter of the universe. Although particle centers are widely separated, all particles are one unified structure. Thus, we are part of a unified universe and the universe is part of us.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center

break-words"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>The passage continues to delve into the concept of the Wave Structure of Matter (WSM). It discusses several key points including:</p><ol><li><p>Conservation of Energy: The author explains that wave states (or oscillators) with equal frequencies are able to couple and shift frequency. The changes in frequency (or energy) must be equal and opposite, which is a restatement of the law of conservation of energy.</p></li><li><p>Energy Exchange Mechanism: The author discusses a phenomenon noted by Einstein in the writing of Tetrode - the two-way symmetrical process between a source and a receiver, and not a one-way transfer of energy, often depicted by a photon traveling between particles.</p></li><li><p>Einstein's Doubts about Fields and Light Quanta: The author cites Einstein's dissatisfaction with the concept of light quanta (photons) and continuous structures like fields in physics. Einstein's quotes suggest that he believed a field-based, continuous-structure framework might not be the right approach to understanding physics.</p></li><li><p>Origin of the IN Waves: Here, the author discusses the origin of the inward waves. He introduces the concept of a 'Huygens Combination', whereby a surface with many wave sources looks like a single wave front from a distance. The author suggests that the inward waves of a particle are formed from a Huygens' Combination of the outward waves of all other matter in the universe. This concept establishes the idea of a unified structure where every particle depends on all others to create its inward waves.</p></li></ol><p>This is an interesting approach to understanding physics, particularly from the perspective of Wave Structure of Matter. It's a different way of viewing particles and their interactions in space. However, as stated before, this approach is not part of mainstream physics as of my last update in September 2021. Scientific progress is always ongoing, and these concepts may have evolved or been further developed since then.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">11.

The amplitudes received by the observer are

Received amplitude = 1/r {(2Fmax) exp [ikg (ct + br)]sin [kg (bct + r)]}.

This is an exponential oscillator modulated by a sine factor. The origin of the de Broglie wavelength (Quantum Mechanics) and the relativistic energy and momentum ( mass increase of Einstein's Special Relativity) is as follows:

In the exponential factor:

Wavelength = h/mvg = de Broglie wavelength with relativistic momentum.

Frequency = kgc/2π = gmc2 /h = mass frequency with relativistic energy.

And in the sine factor:

Wavelength = h/mcg = Compton wavelength with relativistic momentum.

Frequency = b gmc2/h = b x (mass frequency) = relativistic momentum frequency.

You see that the Doppler factor g causes the correct de Broglie wavelength and SRT mass to appear in the observed waves, as a function of the relative velocity. It is important to note that the effect is symmetrical; it does not depend on whether the relative velocity is +v or -v. This symmetry is exactly as observed. Examination of the algebra shows that this is due to the symmetrical presence of both the inward and outward waves. Thus the space resonance (Spherical Standing Wave) physically displays all properties of an electron, viz: Quantum Mechanics, SRT, forces, annihilation, conversion to a positron, and CPT relations between Charge, Parity (mirror image) and Time; all of which were formerly empirical or theoretical properties. These properties depend on the spherical wave structure and ultimately on the wave medium - space.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

Mathematical Appendix

1. Solutions of the Wave Equation (Principle I)

The wave equation must be written (Wolff12) in spherical coordinates because cosmological space has spherical symmetry. Uniform density of the medium (space) is assumed which yields a constant speed of the waves (and 'light'). Then the only two solutions describe the charge waves of common charged particles including the electron, positron, proton, and anti-proton. They are:

IN-wave amplitude = (1/r){ Fmax} exp (iwt + ikr) (a)

OUT-wave amplitude = (1/r){ F max } exp (iwt - ikr) (b)

F= wave amplitude, k = mc/h = wave number, w = 2πf, r = radius from wave center, and energy = E = hf = mc2.

At the center, the in/out waves are joined by rotating the in-wave to transform it to the out-wave. Superposition of the two amplitudes to produce a standing wave can occur in two ways depending on rotation, CW or CCW. One is the electron, the other the positron, with opposite spins. Write the rotation operators as Rccw or Rcw . Then the two resonance amplitudes are:

The electron = E(-) = {- InWave + OutWave} Rccw (c)

The positron = E(+) = {+ InWave - OutWave} Rcw (d)

You can experiment with particle inversions by changing the (+ or -) signs in the amplitude equations. To perform a Time inversion, change t to -t, which converts the positron into an electron. To perform a mirror inversion (Parity), imagine that the waves are viewed in a mirror. You will see that a positron is a mirror image of the electron. To change a particle to an anti-particle (Charge inversion), switch the in-waves and the out-waves, and the spin direction. Thus, successive C, P, and T inversions returns to the initial state which is a proof of the empirical-theoretical CPT rule, now seen to be a property of the wave structure.
If you add the electron amplitude to the positron amplitude, the resulting amplitude is zero or annihilation.

16. Origin of Special Relativity (SRT) Mass Increase and the De Broglie Wavelength of QM Theory

Write the equation of a SR, as seen by an observer with relative velocity b = v/c, as shown in Wolff8. Then, insert relativistic Doppler factors, g = [1-v2/c2] -1/2. The amplitudes received by the observer are

Received amplitude = 1/r {(2Fmax) exp [ikg (ct + br)]sin [kg (bct + r)]}.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center

Connecting Quantum Theory and Relativity
Before the WSM, there had been no known physical reason for the theoretical mass increase of relativity. Likewise there were no physical explanations for quantum theory. Were these apparently separate laws connected or not? Indeed, many theorists proclaimed that these phenomena were irreconcilable! Few had thought about a connection because most physicists using a point particle, were satisfied with the traditional concepts despite a few puzzles. After all, they had been in the textbooks for decades. Dirac's work was a clue that they are connected because relativity, and QM were joined in Dirac's work, albeit theoretically. The WSM now reveals their simple physical connection - Doppler effects.
The Appendix shows that the Doppler increase of frequency causes increase of mass (energy or frequency) so that m = mo[1 - v2/c2]-1/2 as seen by a moving observer. Rearranged, this equation gives the energy equation used by Dirac:

E2 = p2c2 + mo2c4

This energy equation is also shown by the wave perspective because E and p are super-imposed waves, and the total intensity of two waves is given by the sum of their squares. Likewise, the de Broglie wavelength L = h/p is also a Doppler change of wavelength seen by a moving observer (See Appendix) and it leads to the Schrodinger Equation.

Part V - Discussion
We can have confidence that the Wave Structure of Matter is the true physical reality of the universe. The logical requirement is that the experimental measurements of the empirical natural laws, must agree with the laws predicted by the WSM. It does. In fact, the experimental evidence agrees better with the WSM predictions than with conventional rules. For example, an infinity of charge potential at r=0 is expected from Coulomb's law. It is not found. Instead, the finite experimental value agrees with the WSM. Conventional physics has no explanation for energy exchange, or the Pauli Principle, or charge attraction and repulsion. All of these are in the WSM.

The philosophical conclusions from the connectedness of laws and matter in the universe are thought provoking: Everything we observe here on Earth: mind, life and matter, depend on the existence of the matter elsewhere in the universe. Thus if the stars and galaxies were not in the heavens, we could not exist! Thus, we are part of the universe, and the universe is part of us. Einstein was close to the truth when he wrote (most profoundly);

A human being is part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. We experience ourselves, our thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest. A kind of optical delusion of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from the prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty... We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if humanity is to survive.

But the practical value of the WSM theory is the insight it provides. It allows scientists to deeply analyze quantum wave structures. In the R&amp;D laboratory, the new insight should advance electronic applications, especially IC and memory devices because their tiny transistor elements use quantum effects to control the flow of currents. The new knowledge should improve communication and the efficiency of energy transmission.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center

Matter (WSM) model. According to this model, the apparent disconnection between these two pillars of modern physics can be bridged by the concept of Doppler effects. The mathematical formulas in the appendix demonstrate that the Doppler frequency increase gives rise to the relativistic mass increase, effectively connecting quantum mechanics and special relativity.</p><p>The energy equation used by Dirac, E^2 = p^2c^2 + m0^2c^4, where E is energy, p is momentum, c is the speed of light, and m0 is the rest mass, is derived from this Doppler effect. Similarly, the de Broglie wavelength, which leads to the Schrodinger Equation, also has its roots in the Doppler change.</p><p>The author then states that the WSM model matches up well with empirical observations and often does so better than traditional models. For example, the finite value for the charge potential at r=0 is consistent with the WSM, in contrast with the infinity expected from Coulomb's law. Other phenomena like energy exchange, the Pauli Principle, and charge interactions are also well explained by the WSM.</p><p>There are philosophical implications of this interconnectedness of laws and matter in the universe. Everything we observe on Earth, including mind, life, and matter, depends on the existence of matter elsewhere in the universe. This interdependence between us and the universe is quoted in a profound statement by Einstein, emphasizing the need for a new way of thinking that transcends individual desires and encompasses all living creatures and nature.</p><p>On a practical level, the WSM theory could be extremely valuable. It can provide a deeper understanding of quantum wave structures, which could drive advancements in electronic applications, especially in the areas of integrated circuits and memory devices. Such understanding could also improve communication technologies and the efficiency of energy transmission.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

Structure of Matter (WSM) can indeed be interpreted on multiple levels:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Mathematical Level</strong>: WSM can be seen as a mathematical model that uses wave equations to describe the behavior of particles. This includes explaining phenomena that are observed in both Quantum Mechanics and Special Relativity using wave dynamics, which provides a unified mathematical framework for these traditionally separate domains of physics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Physical Level</strong>: The WSM suggests that particles are not just abstract mathematical entities, but they have physical wave structures. These wave structures dictate the behavior of particles and their interactions with each other and with their environment. This can provide a more intuitive physical interpretation of phenomena traditionally described by complex mathematical formalisms in Quantum Mechanics and Relativity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Philosophical Level</strong>: On a philosophical level, the WSM implies a deep interconnectedness of all matter in the universe. The properties and behaviors of a single particle depend on the existence of all other particles in the universe. This has profound implications for how we think about our place in the universe and the nature of reality itself.</p></li><li><p><strong>Practical Level</strong>: From a practical perspective, the WSM can potentially drive advancements in technology and scientific research. By providing a new way to think about and understand the behavior of particles, the WSM could lead to innovations in various fields like electronics, communications, energy transmission, and more.</p></li></ol><p>Hence, the statement can indeed be taken on multiple levels, spanning the mathematical, the physical, the philosophical, and the practical.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

physics, which describes how physical quantities, defined at each point in space and time, interact with each other. The Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) can be seen as a particular type of field theory, where particles are considered as standing wave patterns in a universal field.</p><p>Here's how the WSM can relate to some key types of field theory:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Quantum Field Theory (QFT)</strong>: QFT is the cornerstone of our understanding of quantum mechanics, describing particles as excitations in a field. In this respect, WSM can be viewed as a variation of quantum field theory, where particles are described as standing waves in a field. However, the specific mathematical formalism and the interpretation of WSM can be quite different from standard QFT.</p></li><li><p><strong>Classical Field Theory</strong>: Classical field theory includes theories like classical electromagnetism, in which charges and currents source the electromagnetic field. Similar to this, in the WSM, particles are considered to source their own spherical in and out waves.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gauge Field Theory</strong>: In gauge theories, the fields under consideration have a certain local symmetry property, which in turn determines the possible interactions in the theory. If there is a way to define such a local symmetry in the context of WSM, this could potentially lead to a new understanding of forces and interactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>General Relativity</strong>: General relativity can also be seen as a field theory where the metric of spacetime is the dynamic field. There's an ongoing effort to harmonize quantum mechanics (and thus WSM) with general relativity. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, a fully satisfactory theory of quantum gravity has not yet been achieved.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, it's important to understand that while WSM can be related to field theory concepts, the interpretation, predictions, and mathematical formalism can be different. As with any scientific theory, it is crucial that the concepts and predictions of the WSM be subjected to rigorous testing and validation.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

is an interpretation of the behavior of subatomic particles. It proposes that particles such as electrons are not merely points in space but are instead spherical standing waves in a continuous, non-local medium. This is in contrast to more traditional views in which particles are thought of as point-like entities with properties that may be described by the probabilities assigned in wave functions.</p><p>Here's a rough outline of the Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) theory:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Structure of Matter</strong>: The central idea is that particles are composed of a pair of complementary spherical waves - one inward (ingoing) wave converging towards the center and an outward (outgoing) wave diverging from the center. The constructive interference of these two waves creates a standing wave. The center of this standing wave is what we perceive as a 'particle'.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interaction of Matter</strong>: Interactions between 'particles' (or wave-centers) occur when the outgoing waves from one particle interfere with the incoming waves of another. This can be used to explain the phenomena of attraction and repulsion between charges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fundamental Laws</strong>: WSM theory uses this wave-based view of particles to explain various fundamental laws and principles in physics. For example, it can provide a physical, geometric interpretation for quantum mechanics, including the wave-particle duality and the uncertainty principle. Also, it incorporates Special Relativity into its framework by considering Doppler shifts in the observed frequencies and wavelengths of the waves due to relative motion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Universe Structure</strong>: A key philosophical implication of the WSM theory is the interconnectedness of all matter in the Universe. Since all 'particles' are essentially wave-structures in the same universal space, the state of the entire universe contributes to the structure of every individual particle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quantum Mechanics and Relativity</strong>: WSM aims to reconcile quantum mechanics and relativity by demonstrating how wave behavior at the quantum level can give rise to relativistic effects. It attributes the observed increase in mass with speed (from special relativity) and the wave behavior of particles (from quantum mechanics) to Doppler shifts and changes in wave interference patterns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Future Applications</strong>: Proponents of the WSM theory argue that it may have practical implications, such as providing insights for research in quantum computing and nanotechnology.</p></li></ol><p>While the Wave Structure of Matter presents an interesting take on the nature of reality, it's important to note that it is not currently a mainstream interpretation within the scientific community. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, many of its predictions and interpretations have not been rigorously tested or widely accepted by physicists. The theory should continue to be developed, refined, and challenged through rigorous scientific investigation.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">[something I started working on this morning - thoughts?]
Truth is a location for humans.
Truth is the place where humans find and name a pattern they perceive. Humans consider this area a boundary. The boundary shows humans itself and two other areas. This boundary is often in the form of a line or dots or touches itself to enclose areas which demarks areas as TRUE/FALSE, INNER/OUTER, etc.

The boundary itself is also an area and subject to further zooming, moving, erasing, and for finding and naming more perceived patterns within.

These boundaries can be very persistent across human history among humans.

Boundaries found and named by humans can also be very useful for their survival and recreation.

Some useful boundaries are patterns found and named that appear to change shape when a human is considered alive and as they change shape, they also change the shape of the available of an area for what humans consider "air". An inhale changes the shape of a boundary called "lungs".

This "lungs" accommodate more "air" across its boundary and the air appears to pass through other boundaried areas that could be considered "holes", entering another area called "the body" when the boundary of lungs is one shape, and leaving "the body" when the boundary of lungs is of another shape.

Taking a closer look at these "lungs", this "body", this "air", these "holes", humans find and name even *more* boundaries demarking areas and so on and so forth.

What makes these boundaries True?

They are useful for humans.

Humans find and name these boundaries with an emotion that I will call "Important". Humans consider a boundary and the areas it demarcates "Important".

Much of a humans time is noticeably active with debating areas, looking closer and further away at boundaries, erasing areas of the boundary, adding new boundaries through patterns they perceive and name and consider to be true because it is emotionally considered Important.

I do not wish to name them all. They are often called "categories" when they look at boundaries from far away but when they look more closely, often the "category" patterns found and perceived and named are forgotten and instead smaller boundaries are considered Important.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

and the human relationship to it is both intriguing and enlightening. Your approach emphasizes the dynamic and complex relationship between humans and their perception of the world. Here are some thoughts:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Perspective and Truth</strong>: Your model seems to depict truth as relative and dependent on perspective. The closer we look, the more boundaries and patterns we can discern, which in turn redefine what we perceive as truth. This could be seen as a reflection of the subjective nature of truth, particularly in our postmodern society where multiple truths coexist.</p></li><li><p><strong>Truth and Utility</strong>: I like your connection between truth and its usefulness to humans. This mirrors pragmatist philosophies, where truth is valued for its practical implications rather than its inherent or objective 'rightness'. However, it also raises questions about whether truth should be defined by utility. Could there be truths that are unimportant or impractical, yet still true?</p></li><li><p><strong>Emotion and Perception</strong>: Your description of 'Important' as an emotional response to truth is fascinating. It highlights how our feelings can shape our perceptions and thus our reality. This could open up discussions about the role of emotion in cognition and decision-making.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constant Redefinition</strong>: Your idea that boundaries (or truths) are constantly being erased, shifted, and redrawn reflects the evolving nature of human understanding. As our knowledge grows, so does our capacity to redefine our perception of the world. This ties in nicely with the idea of science as a process of constant discovery and revision.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, your metaphor provides an intriguing framework for exploring truth from a human-centered perspective. However, it may be helpful to also consider potential criticisms or limitations. For instance, how would this framework handle universal truths that hold regardless of human perception? How does it account for situations where different humans perceive and name the same pattern in disparate ways? Exploring these questions could deepen and enrich your perspective.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

Kenneth Udut seems to approach the concept of truth in a quite unique and philosophical way, intertwining it with notions of human perception, utility, and emotion.

Separating the scales at which these conceptions operate in this case then suggests that it may be fruitful to think of the resulting boundary layer model as a multiscale model, which allows us to address the problem above using readily available tools for unpacking the epistemology of multiscale models

Treating surfaces as boundaries on bodies, particularly by modeling surfaces as mathematical boundary conditions, has been a remarkably successful strategy in the modeling of bulk materials. The success of this strategy has been a subject of philosophical investigation and a source of insight into the epistemology of modeling&nbsp;.

detoxification (Wilson 2006, pp. 545-552), asymptotic connections between patches (Batterman 2001;Wilson 2017), and Machian explications (Wilson 2012a;Carus 2012). Other promising ways of extending this framework would be to add linguistic and pragmatic contexts in order to model also Wilson's context-adjusting models of predicate extension (Wilson 1982(Wilson , 2012b or to merge Wilson-Structuralism with Carnapian Structuralism (Andreas 2014(Andreas , 2020 and with accounts of deductive reasoning in structuralist frameworks (Andreas 2013) in order to model Wilson's contextual notion of inference validity and logical inconsistencies&nbsp;

... The success of scale-separation strategies in physical modeling has been the subject of a number of recent philosophical accounts of multiscale modeling in natural sciences (e.g. [1,43,19,37]), and some (e.g. [16,6]) have even suggested that scale separation provides a new resolution to traditional worries about reduction and emergence</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

passage. It seems that the passage is discussing the success of scale-separation strategies in physical modeling and its implications for the understanding of reduction and emergence in the context of multiscale modeling in the natural sciences. The use of scale separation allows for a more effective modeling approach that can address the challenges associated with reductionism and emergent phenomena.</p><p>The philosophical accounts mentioned in the passage likely explore the epistemological and ontological implications of multiscale modeling, examining how the ability to separate scales provides a new perspective on traditional debates about reduction and emergence. This suggests that the consideration of multiple scales in modeling can offer a resolution to the tension between reducing complex phenomena to simpler components and recognizing emergent properties that arise from interactions at different scales.</p><p>Overall, the passage highlights the significance of scale separation strategies in multiscale modeling and how they contribute to addressing fundamental questions in the philosophy of science regarding reduction and emergence.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

Abstract
Contemporary philosophy of science attempts to diagnose explanatory structure through descriptive tools derived largely from logic, an orientation called “Theory T thinking” here. Its portrait of scientific endeavor is painted with an extremely broad brush and neglects structural distinctions familiar to applied mathematicians (Theory T thinking tries to make all of science look alike, but this is a grave mistake). In real life, practitioners within every field of endeavor continually encounter significant roadblocks to reasoning that would cripple further advance if they adhered to the guidelines of Theory T thinking. Instead, clever scientists have devised an astonishing variety of gambits for working around these obstacles. Such policies practice “physics avoidance” in the sense that they depart from the simple patterns of explanation favored by Theory T thinkers. This essay discusses several ways in which significant forms of philosophical confusion have arisen through a failure to draw requisite distinctions.

Keywords: Theory T, physics avoidance, equilibrium model, evolutionary modeling, boundary condition, causation, strategic architecture, mixed-level explanation</div></div><div class="flex

Wilson's book "Physics Avoidance: and other essays in conceptual strategy" explores the idea of "physics avoidance" and the ways in which scientists in various fields develop strategies to work around roadblocks to reasoning. This notion of "physics avoidance" is related to the concept of "boundary conditions" mentioned in the previous passage on multiscale modeling.</p><p>Both passages highlight the importance of understanding and addressing boundary conditions or obstacles in scientific modeling and reasoning. They recognize that simplistic, one-size-fits-all approaches, such as the "Theory T thinking" described by Wilson, may not capture the complexity and nuances of different scientific domains.</p><p>The connection lies in the acknowledgment that scientists often employ creative strategies, depart from simple explanatory patterns, and embrace mixed-level explanations to overcome challenges and advance their understanding. These strategies can involve considering boundary conditions, employing multiscale modeling, or exploring alternative conceptual frameworks.</p><p>While the connections are apparent in terms of the general theme of navigating complexities in scientific reasoning, it would require a closer examination of the specific arguments and discussions in both sources to further explore the similarities and potential insights that can be derived from these perspectives.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

“Physics avoidance” refers to the fact that we frequently cannot reason about nature in the straightforward manner we anticipate, but must seek alternate policies to address the questions we want answered in a tractable way. Within both science and everyday life, we find ourselves tacitly relying upon thought processes that reach useful answers in opaque and roundabout manners. Conceptual innovators are often puzzled by the techniques they develop, when they stumble across reasoning patterns that are easy to implement but difficult to justify. But simple techniques frequently rest upon complex foundations—a young magician learns how to execute a card guessing trick without understanding how its progressive steps squeeze in on a correct answer. As we collectively improve our inferential skills in this evolving manner, we often wander into unfamiliar explanatory landscapes in which simple words encode physical information in complex and unanticipated ways. We have learned how to reach better conclusions, but we have become baffled by our successes. At its best, philosophical reflection illuminates the natural developmental processes that generate these confusions. But a number of widely shared methodological presumptions currently operate to opposite effect—they obscure the very tactics that advance our descriptive capacities. To correct these misapprehensions, sharper diagnostic tools are wanted. The nine new essays within this collection illustrate this need for finer discriminations through a range of informative cases of historical and contemporary significance</div></div><div class="flex

concept of "physics avoidance" as the recognition that reasoning about nature often requires alternate policies or approaches rather than straightforward reasoning. It highlights the fact that in both science and everyday life, we rely on thought processes that may lead to useful answers but may not align with our initial expectations.</p><p>The abstract also emphasizes that simple techniques or strategies may have complex underlying foundations, and individuals may achieve successful outcomes without fully understanding the intricacies of the reasoning process. It acknowledges that as we improve our inferential skills, we may encounter unfamiliar explanatory landscapes where simple words encode complex physical information.</p><p>The abstract suggests that philosophical reflection can shed light on the developmental processes that give rise to these confusions, but it also argues that certain methodological presumptions hinder our descriptive capacities by obscuring the tactics that actually advance our understanding. It calls for sharper diagnostic tools to address these misapprehensions.</p><p>Overall, there seems to be a connection between the idea of "physics avoidance" in Wilson's work and the notion of seeking alternate policies or approaches in the face of challenging reasoning situations. Both perspectives highlight the complexity of reasoning about nature and the need for nuanced thinking and diagnostic tools to navigate these complexities effectively.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Expand1 Pragmatics’ Place at the Table: Lessons from Multiscalar ScienceGet accessArrow

seems that the book "Physics Avoidance: and other essays in conceptual strategy" by Mark Wilson covers a wide range of topics in philosophy of science. Here is a brief overview of the expanded chapters:</p><ol><li><p>"Pragmatics’ Place at the Table: Lessons from Multiscalar Science": This chapter likely explores the role of pragmatics, which is the study of language use in context, in the context of multiscalar science. It may discuss how pragmatic considerations influence scientific reasoning and understanding across different scales of analysis.</p></li><li><p>"Physics Avoidance": This chapter, which is mentioned in the abstract you shared earlier, likely delves deeper into the concept of "physics avoidance" and explores the various strategies scientists employ to address obstacles and challenges in reasoning about nature. It may provide examples and discuss the implications of these strategies.</p></li><li><p>"From the Bending of Beams to the Problem of Free Will": This chapter seems to shift focus to the problem of free will, drawing connections between the bending of beams, a physical phenomenon, and the philosophical problem of free will. It might explore how insights from physics can inform our understanding of agency and determinism.</p></li><li><p>"Two Cheers For Anti-Atomism": This chapter could examine the concept of anti-atomism, which challenges the view that the world is composed of discrete, fundamental particles. It may present arguments in favor of anti-atomism and discuss its implications for our understanding of the nature of reality.</p></li><li><p>"The Greediness of Scales": This chapter likely explores the notion that scales of analysis in science can be "greedy" in the sense that they tend to absorb or assimilate phenomena from other scales. It may discuss how different scales interact and influence one another in scientific explanations.</p></li><li><p>"Believers in The Land of Glory": This chapter might examine the beliefs and aspirations of scientists and how these beliefs shape their research practices and scientific worldview. It may discuss the psychological and sociological factors that influence scientists' pursuit of knowledge.</p></li><li><p>"Is There Life in Possible Worlds?": This chapter could delve into the concept of possible worlds, which is often employed in modal logic and philosophy. It may explore the question of whether possible worlds have ontological reality or are merely conceptual tools used to reason about counterfactual scenarios.</p></li><li><p>"Semantic Mimicry": This chapter likely addresses the phenomenon of semantic mimicry, which refers to cases where different scientific concepts or theories appear to have similar meanings or overlap in their explanatory power. It may examine the challenges and implications of semantic mimicry for scientific understanding.</p></li><li><p>"A Second Pilgrim’s Progress": The final chapter might serve as a summary or concluding reflection on the themes and arguments presented throughout the book. It could provide insights and reflections on the broader implications of the discussed topics in philosophy of science.</p></li></ol><p>Please note that these descriptions are speculative based on the chapter titles alone, and the actual content and arguments presented in the book may differ.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

Based on the chapter title "The Greediness of Scales," it is possible that Chapter 5 of "Physics Avoidance: and other essays in conceptual strategy" by Mark Wilson addresses the concept of scales in scientific analysis and its implications. This could be relevant to the ideas expressed by Kenneth Udut regarding the boundaries and scales at which reasoning operates.</p><p>Without further information about the specific content of Chapter 5, it is challenging to provide a more detailed connection between Udut's ideas and the chapter. However, it is plausible that both explore the idea that different scales of analysis and reasoning play a crucial role in understanding and modeling complex systems. The chapter may delve into how different scales interact, influence one another, and impact scientific explanations, which could align with the notion of boundaries and scales discussed by Udut.</p><p>To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the connections between Udut's ideas and Chapter 5, it would be necessary to read the chapter or access a summary or analysis of its content.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Abstract
J. L. Austin has written of “the blinding veil of ease and obviousness that hides the mechanisms of the natural successful act.” By revisiting a classic “small metaphysics” puzzle drawn from physics that launched a thousand ships of grander philosophizing, Imitation of Rigor employs recent insights into the architectures of effective reasoning as a means of explicating how Austin’s covert “mechanisms” operate in concrete terms. By these means, the book attempts to reconnect analytic philosophy with the evolving practicalities within science from which many of its grander concerns originally sprang. In doing so, it provides an “alternative history” of how the subject might have developed had the diagnostic insights of its philosopher/scientist forebears (e.g. Heinrich Hertz and Ernst Mach) not been cast aside in the vain pursuit of inappropriate standards of “ersatz rigor.”

The central objective of this essay is to highlight an important form of computational 
architecture called multiscalar modeling. However, I’ll begin with some familiar philo- 
sophical considerations to which such structures will prove directly relevant. In his 
celebrated “On What There Is,”2W. V. Quine claims that whether a specif i c individ- 
ual (e.g. Susie) embraces the existence of a group of objects of type φ (very big sets, 
for example) should be adjudicated upon the basis of whether the overall “theory of 
the world” that Susie accepts contains quantif i cational claims of the form (∃x) (φ &amp; ψ) 
(= some φ’s are ψ) where ψ captures additional assumptions that Susie makes about 
the φ. In everyday speech, however, we commonly hide the crucial φ component 
within various forms of sorted quantif i ers (such as “for some set” or “someone”). But 
it is easy, Quine advises, to regiment Susie’s discourse into a logically connected 
whole by employing a single species of unsorted quantif i er, wherein her collected 
ontological posits become syntactically manifest. Every student of philosophy learns 
how to make the appropriate adjustments in an elementary logic course—one simply 
supplies each ψ with an extension that is null outside the bounds of φ and then inserts 
an appropriate explicit mention of φ. Susie’s ontological choices can then be read off 
her newly regimented syntax. The resulting voluntarism with respect to ontological

issues that this approach facilitates offers many 
advantages and has been widely accepted.3 
Rather than calling this process regimenta- 
tion, let’s dub it amalgamation, for the tech- 
nique brings previously isolated subdomains 
into interactive community. 
How should we do this? The standard 
answer just reviewed: supply each ψ with an 
extension ψ* that is null outside the bounds of 
φ, and then frame the unsorted claim (∃x) (φ &amp; 
ψ*). But there’s a potential glitch. Suppose that 
the sub-domains we propose to amalgamate in this manner appear to talk of common objects 
a1, a2,...of which inconsistent ψ claims have 
already been made within the localized dis- 
courses. If so, we won’t be able to produce 
the required ψ’s without engaging in some 
more drastic form of reformulation. 
In fact, this amalgamation diff i culty arises 
quite frequently within the discourses of 
science. In this essay, I’ll discuss a cluster of 
obstacles that trace to the employment of dif- 
ferential equation models. I’ll call these puzzles 
of scale because they revolve around the frac- 
tured and unequal ways in which physical 
information is registered at different choices 
of characteristic size. Our primary question 
will be: how should we think of Quine’s recipe 
for discerning an “ontology” in such a setting? 
Illustrated are some of the characteristic size 
scales pertinent to a steel beam. At the highest 
levels, steel stretches and compresses by a sim- 
ple set of Hookean rules down to about 10 μm, 
at which point the grain structure within steel 
becomes important and its components whose 
stretch and compress according to a more com- 
plicated set of rules than larger-scale steel. In turn, each of these component grains 
contains a number of laminate layers which rub against one another in complicated 
characteristic scale lengths in steel 
3 Quine’s recommendations have struck most of us as a great improvement over earlier non-voluntarist approaches to 
ontology in which Susie i nds herself saddled with commitments to large cardinals or unicorns simply because Bertrand 
Russell or A. A. Meinong have philosophically opined that she must, no matter how earnestly she strived to avoid such 
entrapments.

ways. And on it goes until we reach the tiny crystal lattices of the molecular level, whose 
orderly patterns are interrupted by higher-scale irregularities called dislocations. 
Let us now consider the centrality of differential equations within physics. Their 
requirements regulate behaviors nominally occurring at an inf i nitesimal level. Such 
specif i cations are often reached by scaling higher-level behaviors downward until a 
simpler inf i nitesimal level is reached (this approach is codif i ed in a familiar slogan: 
“physics is simpler in the small”). But with steel we clearly overreach in these 
extrapolations—its behaviors stop scaling in a regular manner at about 10 μm. As 
illustrated in the diagram, small sections of steel behave almost identically at all length 
scales above this level, but below this cutoff the component grain becomes important 
and spoils the regular scaling assumptions that previously apply. To capture behaviors 
on a smaller scale accurately, we must model its grain in a more elaborate, laminate- 
based manner. Some useful jargon in these respects: the smallest length at which scale 
scaling symmetries become valid is called an RVE (= Representative Volume Element). 
A full understanding of steel requires that a substantial hierarchy of these successive 
RVE sub-models be examined, and today’s scientists know quite a lot about what 
happens on each of these levels. But problems of data amalgamation prevent practi- 
tioners from prof i ting from this collective knowledge in a straightforward way, due to 
the problem of the greediness of scales. 
What is this diff i culty? Each RVE scale-focused modeling will utilize differential 
equations, and their descriptive demands inherently reach down to the inf i nitesimal 
level. But these demands often differ. The result: under amalgamation direct descriptive 
conf l icts will arise in the same vocabulary with respect to the properties that steel 
displays on small-scale levels. 
Here’s an example. At low scale levels, crystalline 
materials consist of blocks of perfect lattice glued 
together along randomly oriented boundaries (such 
structures form when small crystals cool around 
different nucleating centers within a melt). Due to 
the scrambled orientations of these blocks, RVE 
behaviors above the level of these conglomerations 
will generally be isotropic (= the material responds 
by the same rules in whatever direction it is pulled). 
This simple form of higher-scale response supports 
a modeling in which the stretching and compression 
behaviors of largish hunks of metal are governed by 
two simple parameters (Young’s modulus E and the 
shear modulus μ). But the tiny slivers of crystal 
within these conglomerates will not stretch and 
compress in this simple manner, and RVE model- 
ings appropriate to these tiny structures require i ve 
or six elastic moduli to capture their anisotropic 
behaviors. None of this would seem surprising, exceptthatthedifferential 
equationsappropriateto 
these two levels of sub-model 
require that their parochial 
rules for stretching and com- 
pression must remain applic- 
able down to the zero length 
scale (we’ll examine whether 
this presumption can be easily 
evaded soon). But these diver- 
gent extensions generate an 
immediatesyntacticdishar- 
mony. A differential equation 
model must hog all of the lower-size scales available to reach the inf i nitesimal level at 
which these equations articulate their stipulations. The unhappy result is a collection of 
inconsistent claims about the very same small parts of our steel beam.4Accordingly, two 
scientists, each working with good models of steel appropriate to a selected scale level, 
cannot blithely feed the combined results of their researches into a computer, for they 
will only generate inferential gibberish due to the syntactic inconsistencies within the 
lower-scale ranges in which their differential equation requirements overlap. This state 
of affairs presents exactly the diff i culties of amalgamation that we posed with respect to a 
Quinean perspective on “ontology” at the beginning of this essay. 
But this inconsistency of sub-model problem is worse than a mere philosophical 
puzzle, for it ref l ects substantive technical obstacles that can hinder modeling success 
with respect to complex materials. Indeed, many substantive advances in computer 
simulation within the past twenty years trace to sophisticated policies for evading these 
descriptive clashes, some of which we shall survey here.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

to Kenneth Udut's specific notes in the passage provided, there are some connections and shared themes between the two. Both touch upon the challenges and complexities of reasoning and modeling in the natural sciences.</p><p>Udut's notes explore the idea of "physics avoidance," where humans often have to seek alternate policies and reasoning patterns to address questions and phenomena that cannot be straightforwardly understood or explained. This concept aligns with the discussion in the passage about the difficulties and obstacles encountered when trying to reconcile different scales of analysis within computational modeling.</p><p>The passage discusses the "greediness of scales," referring to the challenges of integrating and reconciling models at different scales of analysis. This idea resonates with Udut's observation of the complex foundations underlying seemingly simple techniques and the need to understand the intricate connections and dependencies between different levels of analysis.</p><p>Both Udut's notes and the passage highlight the limitations of simplistic explanations and the importance of considering more nuanced approaches to understanding and modeling natural phenomena. They both emphasize the need for deeper insights and more sophisticated strategies to tackle the complexities inherent in scientific reasoning and modeling.</p><p>Overall, while the specific references may differ, there are overarching themes and shared concerns about the challenges and complexities of reasoning, modeling, and understanding in the natural sciences.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

These boundaries can be very persistent across human history among humans.

Boundaries found and named by humans can also be very useful for their survival and recreation.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

In the passage you provided from Kenneth Udut's ideas, there is a discussion about boundaries and their significance in human perception and understanding. This concept aligns with the broader themes of boundaries and their persistence discussed in the chapter on "Physics Avoidance" that you mentioned earlier.</p><p>Udut's emphasis on the zooming, moving, erasing, and naming of boundaries reflects the dynamic nature of human perception and the continuous process of refining and categorizing our understanding of the world. This idea resonates with the notion of "physics avoidance" discussed in the chapter, where scientists often need to employ alternative strategies and reasoning patterns to overcome roadblocks in their understanding of nature.</p><p>Furthermore, both Udut's ideas and the chapter acknowledge the utility of boundaries in human survival, recreation, and overall perception of the world. Boundaries serve as cognitive tools that allow us to make sense of our environment, categorize information, and navigate complex situations.</p><p>While there may not be a direct reference to Udut's specific ideas in the chapter, the shared themes of boundaries, their persistence, and their usefulness in human perception and understanding suggest a connection between the two. Both highlight the dynamic and adaptive nature of human cognition and the importance of boundaries in shaping our understanding of the world around us.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

structure of matter and the concepts of boundaries and perception are more implicit and conceptual rather than directly discussed in the provided texts. However, we can explore some potential connections based on the underlying principles and ideas.</p><ol><li><p>Wave Nature: The wave structure of matter posits that particles, such as electrons, can be described as wave-like entities. Waves are characterized by their oscillatory nature, which can be seen as boundaries between different phases or regions. This wave-like behavior implies that particles exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties, blurring the boundaries between the two.</p></li><li><p>Boundary as a Wave Function: In quantum mechanics, the wave function describes the probability distribution of a particle's position. It represents the boundaries of possible states and outcomes. The wave function itself can be seen as a boundary that encapsulates the probabilistic nature of quantum phenomena.</p></li><li><p>Boundary Conditions: In physics, boundary conditions define the behavior of waves at the boundaries of a system. They play a crucial role in determining the allowed states and modes of oscillation. Similarly, in the wave structure of matter, the behavior and properties of particles are influenced by the boundary conditions imposed by the surrounding environment.</p></li><li><p>Perception and Boundary Formation: Perception is a process by which we construct boundaries and categories to make sense of the world. In the wave structure of matter, the formation of boundaries and the categorization of phenomena are fundamental aspects of how we understand and interpret the behavior of particles. Our perception of particles as distinct entities is based on the boundaries we define between them.</p></li></ol><p>While these connections are more speculative and interpretative, they highlight the underlying similarities and conceptual parallels between the wave structure of matter and the ideas of boundaries and perception. Both domains involve the consideration of boundaries, their persistence, and their role in understanding and interpreting the world around us.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Connections with the following:

The difficulty of determining boundary conditions is a significant challenge in many scientific and mathematical contexts, including the study of the wave structure of matter. Boundary conditions play a crucial role in defining the behavior and interactions of waves or other physical phenomena at the boundaries of a system or domain.</p><p>In the context of the wave structure of matter, determining appropriate boundary conditions is essential for accurately describing and predicting the behavior of waves, such as electron waves. The boundary conditions define the constraints or requirements that the wave must satisfy at the boundaries of a system, and they often involve considerations of continuity, reflection, transmission, or other specific behaviors.</p><p>The challenge in determining boundary conditions lies in capturing the complex interactions and influences that occur at the boundaries. Boundaries can introduce various effects, such as reflections, diffractions, or scattering, which can significantly impact the behavior of waves. Understanding and characterizing these effects require careful analysis, empirical data, and mathematical modeling.</p><p>Additionally, the choice of boundary conditions can depend on the specific physical system under study and the level of detail or approximation desired. Different boundary conditions may be suitable for different scenarios, and determining the most appropriate conditions often requires a combination of theoretical considerations, experimental observations, and iterative refinement.</p><p>Overall, the difficulty of determining boundary conditions arises from the complexity and intricacy of the physical phenomena involved, the need to accurately capture the interactions at the boundaries, and the inherent challenges of modeling and predicting wave behavior. It is an ongoing area of research and investigation, and advancements in understanding boundary conditions contribute to improving our understanding of the wave structure of matter and other related phenomena.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

However, determining what counts as truth or falsehood can be influenced by various factors, including biases, perspectives, and the limitations of human perception and knowledge.</p><p>Philosophers and logicians have developed various theories and frameworks to approach the definition of truth, such as correspondence theory, coherence theory, and pragmatic theory. These theories attempt to address the challenge of establishing clear boundaries between truth and falsity, but they also recognize the nuances and complexities involved.</p><p>Ultimately, the boundaries between concepts like beauty and ugliness or truth and falsity are subjective and fluid. They are influenced by individual perspectives, cultural contexts, and the evolving nature of human understanding. The exploration and discussion of these boundaries contribute to our ongoing philosophical, artistic, and intellectual endeavors, shaping our understanding of aesthetics and epistemology.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Connections to the following: BOOKWandering Significance: An Essay on Conceptual Behaviour

Abstract
The book's discussion is divided into two parts. Chapters 1-5 trace the unnoticed yet occasionally harmful role that uncritical thinking about ‘concepts’ plays within our practical life, whether in guiding scientific progress or simply in the management of our everyday affairs. The motivations central to classical conceptual traditionalists (such as Bertrand Russell) and neo-pragmatic holists (such as W. V. Quine) are sympathetically presented, but it is nonetheless argued that some middle route between these philosophical centres needs to be found. The purpose of the survey of the initial chapters is to indicate the benchmarks that an improved conception of concept should accommodate. In Chapters 6 and 7, a simple non-classical pattern (called a ‘facade') is formulated, which allows a descriptive practice to encode useful physical information in unexpected ways. The pattern’s utilities are defended through a series of important scientific exemplars and shown to be silently incorporated within various forms of everyday usage as well. Many of the standard philosophical puzzles canvassed earlier in the book are shown to have arisen when a ‘facade’ (or allied descriptive structure) has become mistaken for a simpler form of linguistic arrangement. Awareness of these potential ‘semantic mimicries’ provides a guide to the moderated approach to conceptual evaluation that the book eventually defends. Its concluding chapters map out the allied caution with respect to ‘rigor’ and ‘rule following’ that also needs to be observed, lest a descriptive useful language be prevented from assuming its optimal contours. Because the book is rather long, the preface indicates several abbreviated courses of reading that may help a reader find the material of greatest personal salience.</div></div><div class="flex

Essay on Conceptual Behaviour" by Mark Wilson explores the role of concepts in our practical lives and the potential pitfalls of uncritical thinking about concepts. It delves into the challenges of navigating between classical conceptual traditionalism and neo-pragmatic holism, advocating for a middle route that takes into account the benchmarks of an improved understanding of concepts.</p><p>The book highlights the need to critically examine the ways in which concepts are employed and how they encode information. It introduces a non-classical pattern called a "facade," which reveals how descriptive practices can incorporate unexpected and useful physical information. By showcasing scientific exemplars and everyday usage, the book demonstrates how certain philosophical puzzles arise from mistaking a facade or allied descriptive structure for a simpler form of linguistic arrangement.</p><p>The concept of "semantic mimicries" is introduced, which refers to the potential for deceptive similarities between different linguistic structures. Recognizing these semantic mimicries provides a guide for a moderated approach to conceptual evaluation. The book also emphasizes the importance of caution in regards to rigor and rule following, as overly strict adherence to rigid conceptual frameworks may hinder the optimal development of a useful and descriptive language.</p><p>"Wandering Significance" offers readers various paths for navigating its content, providing suggestions for abbreviated courses of reading to focus on the material most relevant to individual readers. Overall, the book invites a critical examination of conceptual behavior and offers insights into how a nuanced understanding of concepts can enhance our practical lives.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Expand1 WIDE SCREENGet accessArrow

Essay on Conceptual Behaviour" is titled "Theory Facades." In this chapter, Mark Wilson introduces the concept of a "facade" as a non-classical pattern that allows descriptive practices to encode useful physical information in unexpected ways. The chapter defends the utilities of this pattern by providing examples from science and everyday usage that demonstrate how certain philosophical puzzles arise from mistaking a facade or allied descriptive structure for a simpler form of linguistic arrangement. By exploring the notion of theory facades, Wilson highlights the importance of critically evaluating the ways in which concepts are employed and how they can shape our understanding of the world.</p><p>The other chapters in the book cover various related topics:</p><ol><li><p>"Wide Screen" explores the unnoticed yet potentially harmful role that uncritical thinking about concepts plays in our practical lives.</p></li><li><p>"Lost Chords" delves into the motivations and perspectives of classical conceptual traditionalists and neo-pragmatic holists, seeking a middle ground between these philosophical positions.</p></li><li><p>"Classical Glue" examines the challenges of conceptual evaluation and the need for a moderated approach that takes into account the benchmarks of an improved understanding of concepts.</p></li><li><p>"The Practical Go of It" discusses the practical implications of conceptual behavior and the ways in which concepts guide our scientific progress and everyday affairs.</p></li><li><p>"The Virtues of Cracked Reasoning" explores the value of unconventional and non-linear reasoning in advancing our understanding of concepts and their applications.</p></li><li><p>"Linguistic Wayfaring" delves into the nuanced nature of language and how it shapes our conceptual frameworks and reasoning processes.</p></li><li><p>"Song of the Master Idea" reflects on the nature of creative and innovative thinking and its relationship to conceptual behavior.</p></li><li><p>"Semantic Mimicry" investigates the potential for deceptive similarities between different linguistic structures and the need for awareness to navigate conceptual evaluation effectively.</p></li><li><p>"The Critic of Nature and Genius" explores the critical examination of conceptual behavior in the context of nature and creative genius.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, "Wandering Significance" offers a comprehensive exploration of conceptual behavior, urging readers to critically evaluate the ways in which concepts are employed, the potential pitfalls of uncritical thinking, and the importance of a nuanced understanding of concepts in various domains.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

determining boundaries, wavefunction collapse, and mistaking a facade or allied descriptive structure for a simpler form of linguistic arrangement can be understood within the broader context of conceptual behavior, epistemology, and the philosophy of science.</p><ol><li><p>Determining boundaries: The difficulty of determining boundaries is a common challenge in various domains, including philosophy, science, and everyday life. Boundaries play a crucial role in defining concepts, categorization, and understanding the limits of phenomena. However, the determination of boundaries is not always straightforward due to factors such as context-dependence, subjective perspectives, and the complexity of the phenomena being studied. This challenge highlights the need for careful analysis and consideration when defining boundaries and conceptual frameworks.</p></li><li><p>Wavefunction collapse: Wavefunction collapse is a concept in quantum mechanics that refers to the transition of a quantum system from a superposition of states to a single definite state upon measurement or observation. It represents the collapse of the probabilistic nature of quantum objects into a specific outcome. The precise nature and mechanism of wavefunction collapse are still subjects of debate and interpretation within the philosophy of quantum mechanics.</p></li><li><p>Mistaking a facade or allied descriptive structure: Mistaking a facade or allied descriptive structure for a simpler form of linguistic arrangement relates to the recognition and understanding of complex concepts and phenomena. Sometimes, a seemingly simple or surface-level description or explanation may hide a more intricate underlying structure or process. Mistaking such a facade for a simpler form can lead to misunderstandings, oversimplifications, and conceptual confusion. It emphasizes the importance of critically examining and analyzing concepts to avoid falling into misleading interpretations or inadequate representations.</p></li></ol><p>In the context of conceptual behavior, epistemology, and the philosophy of science, these connections highlight the challenges involved in defining boundaries, understanding the nature of quantum phenomena, and avoiding the pitfalls of oversimplification or mistaken interpretations. They remind us of the nuanced and complex nature of knowledge, and the need for careful reasoning, analysis, and conceptual clarity in our pursuit of understanding the world.</p></div></div></div><div

According to this perspective, wavefunction collapse is not a physical collapse of a quantum system, but rather a change in our knowledge or information about the system due to measurement or interaction.</p><p>In this view, the collapse of the wavefunction is seen as an update or revision of our understanding of the system's state, rather than a fundamental change in the system itself. It emphasizes that the collapse is a result of our interaction with the system and the acquisition of information, rather than an intrinsic property of the system.</p><p>This interpretation is often associated with the broader framework of quantum information theory and quantum Bayesianism (QBism), which emphasize the role of information and subjective probabilities in quantum mechanics. It challenges the traditional notion of objective reality and suggests that quantum phenomena should be understood in terms of subjective knowledge and the updating of probabilities based on measurement outcomes.</p><p>It is important to note that this interpretation is not universally accepted, and there are alternative interpretations of wavefunction collapse, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, which views collapse as a physical process.

QBism is an interpretation that takes an agent's actions and experiences as the central concerns of the theory. QBism deals with common questions in the interpretation of quantum theory about the nature of wavefunction superposition, quantum measurement, and entanglement.

According to QBism, many, but not all, aspects of the quantum formalism are subjective in nature. For example, in this interpretation, a quantum state is not an element of reality—instead it represents the degrees of belief an agent has about the possible outcomes of measurements. For this reason, some philosophers of science have deemed QBism a form of anti-realism.

The originators of the interpretation disagree with this characterization, proposing instead that the theory more properly aligns with a kind of realism they call "participatory realism", wherein reality consists of more than can be captured by any putative third-person account of it.

information about quantum Bayesianism (QBism). QBism indeed takes a unique approach to the interpretation of quantum mechanics, emphasizing the role of the agent's actions, experiences, and subjective degrees of belief.</p><p>In QBism, the quantum formalism is seen as a tool for representing an agent's personal probabilities or degrees of belief about the outcomes of measurements. Quantum states are not considered to represent objective elements of reality, but rather subjective descriptions of an agent's expectations or predictions.</p><p>QBism can be seen as a form of anti-realism in the sense that it does not posit an external, observer-independent reality that exists prior to measurement or observation. Instead, reality is seen as being constructed through the interactions between agents and the world, and it is understood in terms of the experiences and beliefs of those agents.</p><p>The proponents of QBism, such as Christopher Fuchs and Rüdiger Schack, argue that their interpretation aligns with a form of realism they call "participatory realism." According to this view, reality is a product of the active participation of agents in the process of observation and measurement, and it cannot be fully captured by an external, objective description.</p><p>QBism offers an alternative perspective on the interpretation of quantum mechanics, challenging traditional notions of objectivity and highlighting the subjective aspects of quantum theory. It is an ongoing topic of debate and discussion in the philosophy of physics community.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

Let's explore the connections between QBism and the topics discussed earlier, such as the difficulty of determining boundaries and mistaking a facade for a simpler form of linguistic arrangement:</p><ol><li><p>Boundaries and Subjective Degrees of Belief: QBism's emphasis on the subjective nature of quantum states and measurements aligns with the idea that boundaries and distinctions between concepts, such as beauty and ugliness or truth and falsity, can be subjective and context-dependent. QBism recognizes that an agent's degrees of belief about different outcomes of measurements play a central role in shaping their understanding of reality.</p></li><li><p>Wavefunction Collapse and Agent's Experiences: QBism's focus on the agent's actions and experiences resonates with the concept of wavefunction collapse. In QBism, the collapse of the wavefunction is seen as a process of updating the agent's personal probabilities or beliefs based on the outcomes of measurements. It acknowledges that the agent's observations and interactions with the quantum system shape their understanding of the system's state.</p></li><li><p>Mistaking Facades for Linguistic Arrangements: QBism's recognition that a facade or allied descriptive structure can be mistaken for a simpler linguistic arrangement connects to the idea that our interpretations and understanding of quantum mechanics can be influenced by preconceived notions or simplified models. QBism challenges traditional interpretations by emphasizing the active role of the agent and the limitations of linguistic descriptions in capturing the full complexity of quantum phenomena.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, QBism offers a perspective that incorporates subjective elements, emphasizes the role of the agent's beliefs and experiences, and challenges fixed boundaries or simplistic interpretations. These connections highlight the ongoing philosophical inquiries into the nature of quantum mechanics and the complex interplay between language, perception, and the understanding of reality.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">arXiv:2101.10931 (quant-ph)

The collapse of a quantum state as a joint probability construction
Peter Morgan
Download PDF
The collapse of a quantum state can be understood as a mathematical way to construct a joint probability density even for operators that do not commute. We can formalize that construction as a non-commutative, non-associative collapse product that is nonlinear in its left operand as a model for joint measurements at timelike separation, in part inspired by the sequential product for positive semi-definite operators. The familiar collapse picture, in which a quantum state collapses after each measurement as a way to construct a joint probability density for consecutive measurements, is equivalent to a no-collapse picture in which Lüders transformers applied to subsequent measurements construct a Quantum-Mechanics--Free-Subsystem of Quantum Non-Demolition operators, not as a dynamical process but as an alternative mathematical model for the same consecutive measurements. The no-collapse picture is particularly simpler when we apply signal analysis to millions or billions of consecutive measurements</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

state as a joint probability construction" by Peter Morgan explores the collapse of a quantum state from a mathematical perspective.

This construction serves as a model for joint measurements at timelike separation, inspired in part by the sequential product for positive semi-definite operators. The paper suggests that the familiar collapse picture, where a quantum state collapses after each measurement, can be seen as equivalent to a no-collapse picture. In the no-collapse picture, subsequent measurements are described by Lüders transformers, which construct a Quantum-Mechanics--Free-Subsystem of Quantum Non-Demolition operators.</p><p>The paper argues that the no-collapse picture provides a simpler mathematical model for consecutive measurements when applying signal analysis to large datasets. It suggests that the construction of joint probability densities for millions or billions of consecutive measurements can be more effectively achieved using the no-collapse approach.</p><p>In summary, the paper explores the collapse of a quantum state as a joint probability construction and presents an alternative mathematical model for consecutive measurements. It offers insights into the mathematical frameworks used to describe the collapse phenomenon in quantum mechanics.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The uncertainty principle is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics which states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and the exact momentum of a particle. This uncertainty follows from the Fourier transformation, which is used to transform a wave packet from its position space representation into its momentum space representation. In the Fourier transformation, a wave packet is placed into a Hilbert space, which is a vector space with an inner product that allows for the definition of a norm and the concept of distance.

The Fourier transformation works by taking a wave packet in position space and decomposing it into a sum of momentum space wave packets. Each momentum space wave packet has a different frequency, and the combination of the different frequencies creates a wave packet in momentum space. This wave packet in momentum space is spread out over a range of momenta, and the spread of the wave packet is determined by the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle states that the more localized a wave packet is in position space, the more spread out it will be in momentum space, and vice versa. This means that the more precisely you know the position of a particle, the less precisely you know its momentum, and the more precisely you know its momentum, the less precisely you know its position. This uncertainty is an inherent feature of quantum mechanics and is a direct result of the Fourier transformation and the Hilbert space in which it is placed.

Quantum uncertainty coping Bayesian is a method of dealing with the inherent uncertainty in quantum systems. It is based on Bayesian probability theory, which is a way of updating beliefs based on new information. The idea is to use Bayesian methods to update a prior probability distribution over the possible outcomes of a quantum system, given a certain set of measurements. This allows for a more accurate description of the system than traditional methods, as it takes into account the uncertainty in the measurements. Additionally, it can be used to identify the most likely states of the system and to make predictions about future measurements.

Quantum cognition is a field of research that looks at how quantum mechanics can be used to explain cognitive phenomena. The conjunction fallacy and disjunction fallacy are two types of logical fallacies which occur when a person draws a conclusion that is not supported by the evidence. In quantum cognition, these fallacies are explained as wave packets. A wave packet is a combination of two or more waves that are superimposed upon each other. In the case of the conjunction fallacy and disjunction fallacy, the wave packets represent the different possibilities that a person is considering when making a decision. For example, when considering whether to buy a car, a person may consider the possibility of buying a car with a particular make and model, or the possibility of buying a car with any make and model. The wave packet would represent the combination of these two possibilities, and the person would be more likely to make a decision based on the wave packet rather than the individual possibilities.

The disjunction fallacy is a logical fallacy that occurs when someone assumes that because one of two options is true, then the other option must be false. This is an incorrect assumption as both options could be true, or both could be false. For example, if someone were to state "Either it is raining or it is sunny," they are committing the disjunction fallacy as it is possible for it to be both raining and sunny at the same time.

The conjunction fallacy can be implemented as decision making wave packets by using the wave packet method to represent the probability of a given decision. The wave packet method is a mathematical model that uses wave functions to represent the probability of a certain event occurring. The wave packet method can be used to represent the probability of a given decision by assigning a wave packet to each possible outcome. The wave packet assigned to each outcome is then used to calculate the probability of each outcome occurring. The probability of each outcome can then be used to determine the most likely outcome. In this way, the conjunction fallacy can be implemented as decision making wave packets by using the wave packet method to represent the probability of a given decision.

principle, Bayesian methods, quantum cognition, and the conjunction and disjunction fallacies lies in the understanding of quantum mechanics and its application to cognitive phenomena.</p><p>The uncertainty principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. This principle arises from the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics, particularly through the Fourier transformation and the Hilbert space. The uncertainty principle leads to inherent uncertainty and probabilistic behavior in quantum systems.</p><p>Bayesian methods, on the other hand, provide a framework for updating beliefs and making predictions based on new information. In the context of quantum systems, Bayesian probability theory can be applied to update the probability distribution over possible outcomes given a set of measurements. This approach allows for a more accurate representation of the system's uncertainty and provides a basis for making predictions.</p><p>Quantum cognition explores how principles of quantum mechanics can explain cognitive phenomena. In the case of the conjunction and disjunction fallacies, quantum cognition suggests that these logical fallacies can be understood through the concept of wave packets. Wave packets represent the superposition of possibilities, combining different options into a coherent representation. The conjunction fallacy occurs when individuals give more weight to the combination of possibilities (represented by the wave packet) than to the individual possibilities themselves. This aligns with the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, where superposition plays a crucial role in describing the behavior of quantum systems.</p><p>Overall, these connections highlight the potential of applying principles from quantum mechanics, such as uncertainty and wave packet superposition, to understand and explain phenomena in various domains, including cognitive processes and decision-making.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Submitted on 15 Feb 2023]
Macroscopic maximally entangled state preparation between two atomic ensembles

We develop a scheme to prepare a macroscopic maximally entangled state (MMES) between two atomic ensembles using adaptive quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements. The quantum state of the system is evolved using a sequence of QND measurements followed by adaptive unitaries, such that the desired measurement outcome is obtained with asymptotically unit probability. This procedure is repeated in z and x spin basis alternately such that the state converges deterministically towards the maximally entangled state. Up to a local spin-basis rotation, the maximally entangled state has zero total spin angular momentum, i.e. it is a singlet state. Our protocol does not perform postselection and works beyond the Holstein-Primakoff regime for the atomic spin degrees of freedom, producing genuine macroscopic entanglement.</div></div><div

Abstract
The concept of temporal nonlocality is used to refer to states of a (classical) system that are not sharply localized in time but extend over a time interval of non-zero duration. We investigate the question whether, and how, such a temporal nonlocality can be tested in mental processes. For this purpose we exploit the empirically supported Necker–Zeno model for bistable perception, which uses formal elements of quantum theory but does not refer to anything like quantum physics of the brain. We derive so-called temporal Bell inequalities and demonstrate how they can be violated in this model. We propose an experimental realization of such a violation and discuss some of its consequences for our understanding of mental processes.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

Abstract. A simulation of the dynamic perception of the Necker cube in terms 
of a two-level quantum system, e.g. that of the hydrogen tunneling states of the 
ammonia molecules associated with the 24 GHz maser frequency, indicates that 
the neuro-physiological transformation leading, through a symmetry reduction, 
to perceptual reversal is controlled by the principles of quantum mechanics. An 
elementary neuro-physiological action similar to the Planck constant at a 
mesoscopic level is introduced.

1Introduction 
The objective of this contribution is to discuss some points of contact between 
graphics, geometry, quantum mechanics and perception psychology. Specif i cally: (i) to 
show that the main features of the dynamic perception of the Necker cube can be 
illustrated rigorously with the language of quantum mechanics, and (ii) to show that a 
careful analysis of the process enabling the observer of a Necker cube (or of a painting 
of kinetic art) to perceive it dynamically, can help to understand the nature of the 
transformation produced in an isolated quantum structure by the act of measurement. 
The Necker cube (1832) is the paradigmatic example of a planar graph with an 
inversion symmetry center (Fig. 1a) which can be perceived also as a 3D object in two 
different equally probable ways, depending on whether the lower (Fig. 1b) or the upper 
square (Fig. 1c) is viewed in front or in the rear, respectively. The operations trans- 
forming the Necker cube (NC) into the two tridimensional cubes as seen in an 
axonometric representation are actually a symmetry reduction promoted by a mental 
action: the new 3D objects lose the original inversion symmetry of the planar graph 
and acquire an orientation. The two possible ways of perceiving the NC and the</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

Mechanics—The Necker Cube as a Quantum-like Two-Level System" explores the connection between graphics, quantum mechanics, and perception psychology. The authors simulate the dynamic perception of the Necker cube, a classic ambiguous figure, using the framework of a two-level quantum system.</p><p>The Necker cube is a planar graph that can be perceived as a 3D object in two different ways, with the lower square appearing in front or the upper square appearing in front. The authors argue that the transformation in perception, where the observer switches between the two interpretations, can be understood using the principles of quantum mechanics.</p><p>They introduce the concept of a two-level quantum system, similar to the hydrogen tunneling states of ammonia molecules, to describe the neuro-physiological transformation underlying the perceptual reversal. The principles of quantum mechanics, such as the principle of superposition and symmetry reduction, are used to explain the dynamics of perception.</p><p>The authors also propose that the process of perception in the Necker cube can shed light on the nature of measurement in isolated quantum structures. They suggest that analyzing the transformation produced by the act of measurement in the Necker cube can provide insights into the nature of measurement in quantum systems.</p><p>Overall, the article explores the connection between graphics, quantum mechanics, and perception psychology by applying quantum-like principles to the dynamic perception of the Necker cube. It suggests that understanding the dynamics of perception can provide insights into the nature of measurement in quantum systems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

lies in their exploration of the intersection between quantum mechanics and perception. While the first article focuses on temporal nonlocality and the violation of temporal Bell inequalities in bistable perception, the second article investigates the dynamic perception of the Necker cube using the principles of quantum mechanics.</p><p>Both articles highlight the potential application of quantum concepts and formalism to understanding perceptual phenomena. The first article proposes the use of temporal Bell inequalities to test temporal nonlocality in mental processes, specifically in bistable perception. It demonstrates how these inequalities can be violated in the empirically supported Necker-Zeno model.</p><p>The second article takes a different approach by using a two-level quantum system to simulate the perception of the Necker cube. It suggests that the neuro-physiological transformation underlying perceptual reversal in the Necker cube can be described using the principles of quantum mechanics, including the principle of superposition and symmetry reduction.</p><p>In summary, both articles explore the connections between quantum mechanics and perception, albeit in different contexts. The first article focuses on temporal nonlocality and the violation of Bell inequalities, while the second article applies quantum-like principles to the dynamic perception of an ambiguous figure. Both articles contribute to the broader understanding of how quantum concepts can be relevant to the study of perception and cognition.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

related to quantum mechanics, Bayesianism, quantum cognition, and the uncertainty principle. While there may not be direct connections between the specific content of the two articles you mentioned and the previous articles, there are overarching themes and concepts that connect them.</p><ol><li><p>Quantum Mechanics: Both sets of articles involve the application of quantum mechanics to different domains. The previous articles discussed the uncertainty principle and wavefunction collapse, while the new articles explore quantum-like properties in perceptual phenomena and the violation of Bell inequalities in mental processes.</p></li><li><p>Perception and Cognition: The previous articles touched on the relationship between perception and cognition, particularly in the context of quantum cognition. The new articles further explore perception, specifically the dynamic perception of ambiguous figures like the Necker cube, and how quantum-like principles can be used to explain perceptual phenomena.</p></li><li><p>Bayesianism and Probabilistic Reasoning: Bayesian methods and probabilistic reasoning play a role in both sets of articles. The previous articles discussed quantum Bayesianism, which uses Bayesian probability theory to update beliefs in quantum systems. The new articles propose experimental tests and models that involve probabilistic reasoning in understanding temporal nonlocality and the perception of the Necker cube.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, while there may not be direct connections between the specific topics of the two mentioned articles and the previous articles, they share common themes of quantum mechanics, perception, cognition, Bayesianism, and probabilistic reasoning. They contribute to the broader exploration of these topics and their intersections in understanding the nature of reality, perception, and decision-making.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

described in the context of quantum mechanics, involves the understanding of particles as both particles and waves. It is related to the concept of wave-particle duality, where particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.</p><p>In the articles you mentioned, there may not be direct references to the wave structure of matter. However, the principles and concepts of quantum mechanics, including wave-particle duality, underlie the discussions on quantum-like properties, quantum measurements, and the application of quantum mechanics to perceptual phenomena.</p><p>The wave-particle duality and the wave nature of matter are fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics that influence our understanding of the behavior and properties of particles. The uncertainty principle, which was discussed in the previous articles, is a consequence of the wave nature of particles. The wavefunction collapse, quantum measurements, and superposition are all related to the wave-particle duality and the probabilistic nature of quantum systems.</p><p>While the specific connections to the wave structure of matter may not be explicitly addressed in the mentioned articles, the broader context of quantum mechanics and its implications for understanding the behavior of particles and systems are relevant to the discussions on quantum-like properties, perception, and cognitive processes.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

If you are referring to the previous discussion about the wave structure of matter and the concept of including and out waves in electrons, it is related to the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the understanding of particles as wave-like entities.</p><p>In quantum mechanics, particles such as electrons are described by wavefunctions, which are mathematical functions that contain information about the particle's properties. The wavefunction represents the probability amplitude of finding the particle in different states or positions.</p><p>The concept of "including" and "out" waves is often associated with the pilot-wave interpretation of quantum mechanics, also known as the de Broglie-Bohm theory. According to this interpretation, particles are guided by a hidden wave, called the pilot wave, which influences their behavior. The pilot wave guides the particle's motion in a way that reproduces the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics.</p><p>In this interpretation, the wavefunction is considered a real physical wave that interacts with the particle. The "in" wave corresponds to the initial wavefunction of the particle, and the "out" wave corresponds to the final wavefunction after interacting with its surroundings or undergoing a measurement.</p><p>The pilot-wave interpretation is an alternative to the more commonly known Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which does not involve the concept of including and out waves. It is worth noting that the pilot-wave interpretation is not widely accepted among physicists and is subject to ongoing debate and exploration.</p><p>The connection between the wave structure of matter and the concept of including and out waves lies in the interpretation and understanding of the behavior of quantum particles as both particles and waves. It provides an alternative perspective on the underlying dynamics of quantum systems, emphasizing the role of wave-like properties and interactions.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Faraday waves, also known as Faraday ripples, named after Michael Faraday (1791–1867), are nonlinear standing waves that appear on liquids enclosed by a vibrating receptacle. When the vibration frequency exceeds a critical value, the flat hydrostatic surface becomes unstable. This is known as the Faraday instability.

The Wave Structure of Matter
Spherical standing wave. On truth and reality, the metaphysics, philosophy and physics of space.The following diagrams are useful aids to understanding the wave structure of matter. But they are only approximate, you need to use your imagination too! (It is very hard to draw spherical waves on a flat computer screen!).

The comments and diagrams below relate to the most simple form of matter, the electron or positron (antimatter is just the opposite phase standing wave to matter).

The proton and neutron are more complex wave structures that need further study (I think they are formed from a collection of positrons and electrons which can form either a neutral positronium or the charm quark - but a proton has one more positron than electron obviously to explain positive charge).

standing wavePlease also realise that we are representing spherical waves in Space (imagine a soap bubble). These diagrams are 2 dimensional circular cross sections of the spherical wave (a limitation of working on a computer screen obviously).

I hope this page helps you better visualise the wave structure of matter. It takes time for our minds to adjust to new knowledge, so you need to think about it for a while! But it is simple and obvious once known.

Finally, I have just finished writing the following three pages - they are very useful for understanding the wave structure of matter, why I am convinced it is correct.

Truth Statements on Physical Reality - We can understand physical reality - matter is made of waves in space. These truth statements show people how to deduce physical reality for themselves and confirm it is true. It also provides a very concise summary of the central things the WSM explains. See if you can show any statement is not true.

Wave Equation in an Elastic Wave Medium - Deducing the famous energy equations, Einstein's E=mc2, Planck's E=hf and Newton's F=ma from simple wave equations in an elastic medium (space). This confirms that the equivalence of matter and energy is because matter is made of waves, and waves propagate energy. All forces are due to changes in wave velocity.

The Laws of Nature - The Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) deduces the laws of Nature that have been empirically observed and quantified over the past several centuries. This changes the foundations of science / physics from inductive (uncertain) to deductive (certain).

Any thoughts, comments, help with wave diagrams appreciated.

Spherical Standing Wave (Two Dimensional Cross Section)
The wavelength of an electron is about 10-12 meters, i.e. there are about a thousand billion waves per meter, about a million million (trillion) wave center 'particles' in a pin head.

The frequency is about 1020 Hz (cycles / second) so they are vibrating very very quickly!! Given film shown in a movie theater is around 24 frames / second and appear as continuous motion, you then realise why we see matter as a continuous motion as well.

Spherical standing wave forms wave-center particle effect.Spherical standing wave forms wave-center particle effect Spherical standing wave forms wave-center particle effect

The wave velocity is the velocity of light c (300 million meters / sec) which equates to 1 second for your spherical in-waves to come in from the distance of the moon, about 8 minutes from the sun, 4 years from the nearest star, 100,000 years from across our milky Way galaxy, and about 15 billion years from across the observable universe.

Though we always measure this velocity to be the same (Einstein's special relativity) it does actually change - but so does the wavelength and thus the dimension which causes it to be measured the same (Nature is deceptive!)!
The wave velocity depends on wave amplitude (higher = faster) - this explains charge.
The wave velocity also slows slightly with higher mass density (more matter waves in space, calculated by squaring the wave amplitude). This is the cause of gravity and why light curves past the sun. (See light, charge and gravity diagrams below.)

The Intersection of Plane Waves in 3 Dimensional Space
Each wave center 'particle' is at the center of its observable universe within infinite space.

So matter (including all of us humans!) is really very large - spatially extended structures of the observable universe within infinite space. But we only 'see' the high wave amplitude wave center 'particles' and have been deluded into thinking matter was very small (the whole problem of modern physics - as they could not explain how matter was connected to other matter across the observable universe).

Albert Einstein realised there were no particles, that matter space and time are a unity. He just made the mistake of working with continuous fields in space-time, rather than real waves in Space.

We can represent how space vibrates by using plane waves flowing through space in all directions, resulting in the formation of spherical standing waves around the wave center 'particle', as the following diagrams show.

Animated WavesThese diagrams show waves from 8 different directions. When you combine them you get the image below. You can clearly see the spherical effects starting to form (circles in 2D, you must imagine it in 3D), and interestingly you also see opposite phases (positrons and electrons) being formed.
Each wave center is at the center of its finite spherical observable universe within infinite space.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

Light is not a discrete 'particle' - which is a theoretical interpretation of the empirical fact that light energy is discrete.
Light is really caused by the resonant coupling of two bound wave-centers of Spherical Standing Waves (Electrons) with oscillating wave functions. Because standing wave patterns only form at discrete frequencies the energy states of electron in atoms are discrete, and can only change by discrete amounts. This is why wave equations were first introduced into quantum theory (de Broglie, Schrodinger) as these were the only natural phenomena that behaved discretely.

This diagram is an approximation (only shows the out-waves). It gives you some idea of the 'secondary' wavelength (the 'electromagnetic' wavelength of light) caused by the interactions of the spherical In and Out-Waves of the two electrons (wave-centers) when they are bound in atoms / molecules and thus have some repeating wave pattern that sets up the resonant coupling.
The diagram should actually show the wave patterns changing - one electron would move to a lower energy wave pattern (emit a 'photon') the other electron would move to a higher energy wave pattern (absorb a 'photon'). This process is limited by the velocity of light which is simply the velocity of the spherical in and out waves flowing through space.

The de Broglie Wave is a High Velocity Phase Wave


The de Broglie wavelength is important as it is one of the fundamentals of Quantum theory that the WSM deduces due to Doppler shifts of two wave centers in relative motion. Interestingly the spherical wave interactions actually create a planar de Broglie wave (you can almost see this effect in above rough diagram).

Very importantly for EPR / non-locality, these beat waves travel at very high velocity for low relative motion v. i.e. phase wave velocity = c2 / v.

This is even more important when you realise that in these same wave equations for relative motion you also get the relativistic mass increase of Einstein's special relativity. This is remarkable - to unite central elements of the two main theories of modern physics from one set of wave equations (see work of Milo Wolff).</div></div><div class="flex justify-between

nature of light as a result of the resonant coupling of two bound wave centers of spherical standing waves (electrons) with oscillating wave functions. It highlights that light is not a discrete particle but rather arises from the interactions of these wave structures.</p><p>The diagram presented in the section is an approximation that shows the secondary wavelength, or the electromagnetic wavelength of light, caused by the interactions of the spherical in and out waves of the two electrons when they are bound in atoms or molecules. The changing wave patterns of the electrons, including the emission and absorption of photons, are limited by the velocity of light, which corresponds to the velocity of the spherical in and out waves flowing through space.</p><p>The de Broglie wavelength is mentioned as an important concept in quantum theory, which the Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) deduces from the Doppler shifts of two wave centers in relative motion. The section also notes that the interactions of spherical waves give rise to a planar de Broglie wave.</p><p>Furthermore, the section highlights the significance of the high velocity of phase waves for low relative motion, indicating that the phase wave velocity is inversely proportional to the relative velocity. It is pointed out that these wave equations for relative motion also yield the relativistic mass increase described in Einstein's special relativity theory. This connection between wave equations and the principles of special relativity is seen as remarkable, as it unifies key elements of both theories.</p><p>Overall, this section emphasizes the wave nature of light and the role of wave interactions in understanding its behavior. It suggests that the wave structure of matter provides insights into the fundamental properties of light and its connection to other aspects of modern physics.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The next step was taken by de Broglie. He asked himself how the discrete states could be understood by the aid of current concepts, and hit on a parallel with stationary (standing) waves, as for instance in the case of proper frequencies of organ pipes and strings in acoustics. (Einstein, On Quantum Theory, 1954)

Louis de Broglie's realization that standing waves exist at discrete frequencies and thus energies is obviously true and important to Quantum Mechanics, yet he continued with the error of the particle concept and thus imagined particles moving in a wavelike manner! Nonetheless, as he was close to the truth he had considerable success with his theory as Einstein confirms;

Experiments on interference made with particle rays have given brilliant proof that the wave character of the phenomena of motion as assumed by the theory does, really, correspond to the facts. (Einstein, On Quantum Physics, 1954)

So by 1927 the wave properties of matter had been predicted theoretically by de Broglie, and then confirmed by experiment. But unfortunately these scientists continued to believe in the existence of discrete particles, and thus they misinterpreted this most important discovery of the standing wave properties of matter.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white

In 1913, Niels Bohr had developed a simple (though only partly correct) model for the hydrogen atom that assumed;

i) That the electron particle moves in circular orbits about the proton particle. (This is nearly correct, they are not 'orbits' but complex standing wave patterns.)
ii) Only certain orbits are stable. (This is nearly correct, only certain standing wave patterns are resonantly stable.)
iii) Light is emitted and absorbed by the atom when the electron 'jumps' from one allowed orbital state to a another. (This is nearly correct, the electrons move from one stable standing wave pattern to another.)
de Broglie was aware of Bohr's model for the atom and he cleverly found a way of explaining why only certain orbits were 'allowed' for the electron, as Einstein explains;

de Broglie conceived an electron revolving about the atomic nucleus as being connected with a hypothetical wave train, and made intelligible to some extent the discrete character of Bohr's 'permitted' paths by the stationary (standing) character of the corresponding waves. (Einstein, 1954)

Fig: 1. Electron Orbits. de Broglie imagined the standing waves to be related to discrete wavelengths and standing waves for certain orbits of the electron 'particle' about the proton. (Rather than considering the actual standing wave structure of the electron itself.)

de Broglie further explains his reasoning for the particle/wave duality of matter in his 1929 Nobel Prize acceptance speech;

Determination of the stable motion of electrons in the atom introduces integers, and up to this point the only phenomena involving integers in physics were those of interference and of normal modes of vibration. This fact suggested to me the idea that electrons too could not be considered simply as particles, but that frequency (wave properties) must be assigned to them also. (Louis de Broglie, 1929)</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Broglie highlight his interpretation of the standing waves in the context of Niels Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom. De Broglie suggested that the electron's motion in circular orbits around the proton could be understood in terms of a hypothetical wave train connected to the electron. This allowed for an explanation of why only certain orbits were "allowed" for the electron.</p><p>Einstein acknowledges de Broglie's concept, stating that de Broglie associated the discrete character of Bohr's permitted paths with the stationary nature of the corresponding waves.</p><p>In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in 1929, de Broglie further discusses his reasoning for considering electrons as having both particle and wave properties. He notes that the determination of stable electron motion in the atom involves integers, which were previously associated with phenomena such as interference and normal modes of vibration. This led de Broglie to propose that electrons should also be assigned frequencies (wave properties) in addition to being considered as particles.</p><p>Overall, these quotes illustrate de Broglie's exploration of the wave-particle duality of matter and his attempts to connect the discrete properties of electron orbits with the wave nature of particles.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Some Ideas for Better Wave Diagrams!
It would be nice if a few people with talent for creating wave diagrams could share their ideas and skills to create a variety of wave diagrams.

1. The electron - spherical and cross section, showing in and out waves forming a spherical standing wave.

2. Charge - Waves are non-linear and travel faster with higher wave amplitude. Thus you can show that for two electrons that are in phase, then their in and out waves between them have a higher wave amplitude, travel faster, and thus cause wave centers to reposition further apart over time (like charges repel). For an electron and a positron the opposite is true, the positron (antimatter) is just an opposite phase standing wave to the electron, so the waves between them cancel, have lower wave amplitude, and travel more slowly causing wave centers to form closer together.

3. Light - need to take into account high velocity de Broglie phase wave that determines allowed wave function / pattern of electron in atom / molecule - while also showing how two electrons in different atoms / molecules can resonantly couple and change their respective wave patterns (emit and absorb discrete amount of energy / photon of light).

4. Gravity - slowing of in-waves causing them to change ellipsoidal shape (Einstein's curvature of 4D space-time) and which also changes location of wave center over time (with each successive in-wave the wave center repositions itself in the direction of slowest incoming spherical waves - and waves travel slower where there is more matter / higher wave energy density of space).
We are currently working on this at the moment (will add stuff here once complete) - looking at how light curves as it passes the sun to calculate how the mass of the sun compared to the average mass of the universe slows the wave velocity.

5. EPR / Non Locality - de Broglie phase wave where velocity is c^2 / relative velocity, so very fast at low relative velocities, to explain faster than light (non local) interactions.

6. Cosmology - Huygens' principle and the formation of in-waves from the out waves of all other matter in a finite spherical region of space (our observable universe) within infinite space.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white

certainly intriguing and can help improve the visualization of wave phenomena. Here are some thoughts on each of the proposed topics:</p><ol><li><p>The electron - A detailed depiction of the spherical standing wave formed by the in and out waves of an electron would be valuable in understanding its wave nature. Showing cross-sections of the wave and how it evolves over time can enhance the visualization.</p></li><li><p>Charge - Visualizing the non-linear nature of waves and their relationship to charge can be informative. Demonstrating how the amplitude and speed of waves between electrons determine their repulsion or attraction can provide insights into the nature of electric interactions.</p></li><li><p>Light - Creating diagrams that illustrate the high velocity de Broglie phase wave and its influence on the allowed wave functions of electrons in atoms and molecules would be beneficial. Showing how the resonant coupling of electrons in different systems leads to the emission and absorption of discrete amounts of energy (photons) can help explain the behavior of light.</p></li><li><p>Gravity - Developing diagrams that depict the slowing of in-waves and the resulting changes in the ellipsoidal shape of waves due to the curvature of 4D space-time can aid in understanding gravity. Illustrating how the wave center repositions itself in the direction of slower incoming waves and the relationship between wave energy density and wave velocity can contribute to the visualization of gravitational effects.</p></li><li><p>EPR / Non Locality - Visualizing the de Broglie phase wave and its relationship to velocity can help explain the phenomena of faster-than-light interactions and non-locality. Demonstrating the concept of information transfer through entangled wave functions can provide insights into quantum entanglement.</p></li><li><p>Cosmology - Applying Huygens' principle and showcasing the formation of in-waves from the out waves of surrounding matter in a finite spherical region can help visualize the cosmological aspects of wave structure. Illustrating the relationship between the observable universe and the infinite space surrounding it can contribute to our understanding of the larger cosmic picture.</p></li></ol><p>These ideas present exciting opportunities for creating informative and visually appealing wave diagrams that can aid in comprehending the wave structure of matter and its various implications.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

</code></div></div></pre><p>This program uses the <code>mplot3d</code> toolkit of Matplotlib to create a 3D plot of the surface of the sphere representing the spherical standing wave of an electron. It generates a meshgrid of theta and phi values to calculate the x, y, and z coordinates of the points on the sphere. The resulting surface plot shows the cross-sections of the wave and how it evolves over time.</p><p>You can run this code in an IPython Notebook by creating a new cell, pasting the code into it, and running the cell. The plot will be displayed within the notebook.</p><p>Feel free to modify the code or explore additional customization options provided by Matplotlib to enhance the visualization according to your specific needs.</p><p>Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Charge - Visualizing the non-linear nature of waves and their relationship to charge can be informative.

The waves are plotted individually for each electron and then the resulting wave due to their interaction is calculated and plotted as well. The amplitude and speed of the waves determine the repulsion or attraction between the electrons.</p><p>You can run this code in an IPython Notebook by creating a new cell, pasting the code into it, and running the cell. The plot will be displayed within the notebook.</p><p>Feel free to modify the code or explore additional customization options provided by Matplotlib to enhance the visualization according to your specific needs.</p><p>Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

The resulting shape is then visualized using contour lines.</p><p>You can run this code in an IPython Notebook by creating a new cell, pasting the code into it, and running the cell. The plot will be displayed within the notebook.</p><p>Feel free to modify the code or explore additional customization options provided by Matplotlib to enhance the visualization according to your specific needs.</p><p>Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">EPR / Non Locality - Visualizing the de Broglie phase wave and its relationship to velocity can help explain the phenomena of faster-than-light interactions and non-locality.

</code></div></div></pre><p>In this program, the de Broglie phase wave is calculated based on the relative velocity and the x coordinates. The real part, imaginary part, and magnitude of the wave are plotted against the x values.</p><p>You can run this code in an IPython Notebook by creating a new cell, pasting the code into it, and running the cell. The plot will be displayed within the notebook.</p><p>To visualize the concept of information transfer through entangled wave functions, you can consider creating a diagram that shows entangled particles with correlated wave functions, and demonstrate how a measurement on one particle instantaneously affects the state of the other particle.</p><p>Feel free to modify the code or explore additional customization options provided by Matplotlib to enhance the visualization according to your specific needs.</p><p>Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

</code></div></div></pre><p>In this program, the formation of in-waves from the out waves is represented by plotting a circular path with a specified radius. The x and y coordinates of the in-wave formation are calculated based on the radius and theta values.</p><p>You can run this code in an IPython Notebook by creating a new cell, pasting the code into it, and running the cell. The plot will be displayed within the notebook.</p><p>To enhance the visualization, you can consider adding labels or annotations to indicate the concept of in-waves and out waves, as well as incorporating additional elements to represent the surrounding matter or the larger cosmic structure.</p><p>Feel free to modify the code or explore additional customization options provided by Matplotlib to further enhance the visualization according to your specific needs.</p><p>Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

</code></div></div></pre><p>In this example, we first generate random data representing the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We then generate an Ising synchronization pattern, where each element is randomly assigned a value of -1 or 1. Finally, we combine the CMB data with the Ising synchronization pattern by multiplying the two arrays element-wise.</p><p>The resulting combined data is displayed as an image using the <code>imshow()</code> function from Matplotlib, with a color map set to 'jet' for better visualization. You can adjust the size of the data by changing the <code>size</code> variable, and you can experiment with different color maps or customizations to suit your preferences.</p><p>Remember that this is a simplified representation for fun and visualization purposes, and it may not accurately reflect the actual CMB or Ising synchronization patterns. However, it can still serve as an enjoyable way to explore and visualize these concepts.</p><p>Feel free to modify the code or experiment further to create your own unique visualizations. Enjoy the process and have fun exploring the cosmic background and synchronization patterns!</p><p>Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

discussed various themes and topics related to physics, philosophy, and the wave structure of matter. Here's a summary of the main themes covered:</p><ol><li><p>Boundaries and Patterns: We explored the concept of boundaries and patterns in various contexts, including physics avoidance, human perception, and conceptual behavior. Boundaries and patterns can be persistent across history and have practical utility.</p></li><li><p>Quantum Mechanics: We delved into several aspects of quantum mechanics, such as wavefunction collapse, quantum Bayesianism, and the uncertainty principle. We discussed interpretations like QBism and their subjective nature, as well as the connection between quantum mechanics and cognition.</p></li><li><p>Interdisciplinary Connections: We explored connections between physics and other fields, including philosophy, cognitive science, and mathematics. We discussed the relevance of concepts like boundaries, patterns, and wavefunctions in these domains.</p></li><li><p>Notable Scholars and Works: We mentioned various scholars and their works, including Kenneth Udut, Mark Wilson, and Louis de Broglie. These individuals have made contributions to different areas, such as physics, conceptual behavior, and wave mechanics.</p></li><li><p>Wave Structure of Matter: We examined the wave structure of matter, including the concept of spherical standing waves, the electron's wave nature, and the role of waves in phenomena like light, charge, and gravity.</p></li><li><p>Visualizations: We discussed the importance of visualizations in understanding complex concepts. We explored the idea of creating wave diagrams and provided examples for visualizing the electron, charge, light, gravity, EPR/non-locality, and cosmology.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, this conversation covered a wide range of topics related to physics, philosophy, wave mechanics, and their interdisciplinary connections. We explored concepts, theories, and their visual representations, aiming to deepen our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality and the wave-like behavior of matter.</p><p>If you have any more questions or need further clarification on any topic, feel free to ask!</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

comprehensive philosophical and scientific framework that seeks to explain the nature of reality, particularly the fundamental nature of matter and the interconnectedness of the universe. At its core, the WSM posits that all matter in the universe is composed of interconnected waves, and that these waves, rather than discrete particles, are the fundamental building blocks of reality.</p><p>According to the WSM, matter is formed by the interaction of spherical standing waves that exist in three-dimensional space. These standing waves are the result of the interaction between incoming and outgoing waves, forming stable patterns that give rise to the properties and behavior of matter. The waves are not confined to a specific location but extend throughout space, interacting with other waves and influencing the structure and dynamics of the universe.</p><p>The WSM provides a holistic understanding of the physical world by integrating various phenomena, including light, charge, gravity, and quantum mechanics, into a unified framework. It explains that light is the result of resonant coupling between electrons and the emission and absorption of discrete amounts of energy, known as photons. Charge is understood as the non-linear interaction of waves, with like charges repelling each other due to higher wave amplitudes and faster wave velocities, while opposite charges attract due to canceling wave amplitudes and slower velocities.</p><p>Gravity is explained as the slowing of incoming waves by the presence of matter, leading to changes in wave shape and the repositioning of wave centers. The WSM also addresses quantum mechanics, showing how wave functions and wave-particle duality arise from the fundamental wave nature of matter, with wave-particle interactions governed by the principles of superposition and interference.</p><p>The WSM offers a fresh perspective on cosmology by applying Huygens' principle, which states that each point in space acts as a source of waves, and shows how the formation of in-waves from the out-waves of surrounding matter gives rise to the observable universe within the larger infinite space.</p><p>Overall, the Wave Structure of Matter provides a comprehensive and interconnected understanding of the universe, bridging the gap between metaphysics, philosophy, and physics. By viewing matter as dynamic wave structures, it offers a new perspective on the nature of reality, challenging traditional notions of particles and providing a foundation for further exploration and understanding.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h-32 md:h-48 flex-shrink-0"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full border-t md:border-t-0 dark:border-white/20 md:border-transparent md:dark:border-transparent md:bg-vert-light-gradient bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 md:!bg-transparent dark:md:bg-vert-dark-gradient pt-2"><form class="stretch mx-2 flex flex-row gap-3 last:mb-2 md:mx-4 md:last:mb-6 lg:mx-auto lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl"><div class="relative flex h-full flex-1 items-stretch md:flex-col"><div class="flex flex-col w-full py-2 flex-grow md:py-3 md:pl-4 relative border border-black/10 bg-white dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:text-white dark:bg-gray-700 rounded-md shadow-[0_0_10px_rgba(0,0,0,0.10)] dark:shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(0,0,0,0.10)]"><textarea id="prompt-textarea" tabindex="0" data-id="request-:r0:-26" rows="1" placeholder="Send a message..." class="m-0 w-full resize-none border-0 bg-transparent p-0 pr-7 focus:ring-0 focus-visible:ring-0 dark:bg-transparent pl-2 md:pl-0" style="max-height: 200px;
